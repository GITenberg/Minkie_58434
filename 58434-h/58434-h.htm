<p class="ph3">HOW A BOGEY-MAN CAME TO DALE END</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>Told by Bobby, the Horse</i></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>INKIE says I ought to begin this story,
because I am the biggest and strongest.
I don&rsquo;t see that at all, but she thinks I can&rsquo;t
see much, anyhow, owing to my silly habit of
wearing blinkers, which is just her irritating
way of settling an argument&mdash;as if <i>I</i> made
the harness. And she knows better, too.
I have an eye stuck on each side of my head to
enable me to look nearly all round the circle;
but that clever individual, man, tries to improve
on Providence by making me don the
rogue&rsquo;s badge. Well, it would make any
horse laugh. You watch how the clever
individual came to grief when Minkie and
her gang tackled him. Yes, that is what they
call us&mdash;her &ldquo;gang&rdquo;&mdash;although Dandy, the
<span class="pagenum padpage" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>fox-terrier, won&rsquo;t admit that Tibbie belongs
to our crowd, and he gets furious if one even
mentions the Parrot. Perhaps he is prejudiced
against Tibbie&mdash;I have noticed that
most dogs seldom have a good word for a cat&mdash;but
I do agree with him about that green
idiot, Polly. Of all the back-biting, screeching&mdash;Eh,
what? Oh, don&rsquo;t worry, as I tell
Dan when he trots in to my place to look for
a rat&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be in the middle of a real up-to-date
yarn in two buzzes of a gad-fly....</p>

<p class="indent">The fun started last Christmas Eve, when
a small blue boy on a big red bicycle came to
our front door and tried to pull the bell out
by the roots after playing tricks with the
knocker. Everybody thought it was a parcel
for herself. Dorothy sailed out of the drawing-room;
Cookie and Evangeline, our housemaid
(Mam wanted to call her Mary, but
she threatened to give notice), rushed from
the kitchen; even dearest Mam dropped her
sewing and wondered what the Guv&rsquo;nor had
sent her; but Minkie tobogganed downstairs
on a tray, and came in an easy first. Dan
was close up, as he simply hates every sort of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>postman; so Minkie grabbed him with one
hand and opened the door with the other.</p>

<p class="indent">And it was only a telegram.</p>

<p class="indent">When Mam opened it, she said &ldquo;Good
gracious!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;What is it, mother?&rdquo; inquired Dorothy.</p>

<p class="indent">But Minkie had read it over Mam&rsquo;s shoulder
and it was just this:</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Schwartz arrived unexpectedly to-day.
Have invited him to spend Christmas and
New Year with us. Send victoria meet 2.15.
Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Tom is the Old Man. His other name is
Grosvenor. He isn&rsquo;t really old, but Jim calls
him the Old Man, or the Guv&rsquo;nor, and we
are all pretty free and easy in the stable, you
know.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; said Mam again, &ldquo;he
will be here in half an hour. Evangeline,
run and tell James to drive to the station at
once. Mr. Grosvenor is bringing a friend
home with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Now, it is to be observed, in the first place,
that ladies are always flustered by telegrams.
The Old Man said nothing about &ldquo;bringing&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>Schwartz by the 2.15, and Mam knew quite
well that he expected to be detained at the
office until the 5.30. Next, when two-legged
people are in a hurry, they put the rush on
to their four-legged helpers. I was just enjoying
a nice wisp of hay when Jim banged in
and rattled me into my harness, while Mole,
the gardener, who also cleans the knives and
boots, pulled the victoria out of the shed.</p>

<p class="indent">I was going through the gate in fine style
when Minkie came flying.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo; she said, and skipped inside.</p>

<p class="indent">Jim thought Mam had sent her, but Jim
is always wrong when he imagines anything
about Minkie. The fact was, as she told me
afterwards, she had heard a lot of talk about
this Schwartz, and she felt that it would be
good for all parties if she took his measure
a few minutes ahead of the rest of the family;
so she jammed on a pirate cap and Dorothy&rsquo;s
fur coat, and slid across the lawn without
any one&rsquo;s being the wiser, except Dan, and he
was sore with her on account of the escape
of the telegraph boy. He tried to take it out
of Tibbie, but she nipped up a tree, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>parrot, who was watching him head downwards
through the drawing-room window,
yelled &ldquo;Yah!&rdquo; at him. That settled it.
He came after me and jumped up at my
bit.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Race you to the station,&rdquo; he said, pretending
he hadn&rsquo;t seen Minkie.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but, to make a match
of it, you ought to get Mole to harness you
to his little girl&rsquo;s toy pram.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">This remark seemed to hurt his feelings,
but I didn&rsquo;t know then about the rat-tatling
messenger boy. Anyhow, he met the doctor&rsquo;s
poodle in the village, so he joined us at
the station in a good temper.</p>

<p class="indent">When the train arrived, it brought heaps
of people. It always puzzles me that folk
should gorge more at Christmas time than
any other. Every man, woman, and child
carried half-a-dozen parcels, and nearly every
parcel held something to eat. Some of the
men hugged long narrow boxes, which looked
as if they contained wax candles, but which
really held a bottle of whisky. I know, because
Jim....</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;Mr. Grosvenor hasn&rsquo;t come, miss,&rdquo; said
Jim, when the crowd thinned.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Who said he was coming?&rdquo; asked Minkie.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, Evangeline thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Evangeline never thinks. The doctor has
warned her against it. If ever she tries to do
anything of the kind the excitement will kill
her. No, Jim. Dad has told a Mr. Schwartz
to come on by this train, and make himself
at home until he joins him later. Schwartz
is German for black. Most Germans are
dumpy. But things often go by contraries.
Our green-grocer is named Brown, so Mr.
Schwartz should be a tall thin man, with
straw hair and white eyebrows.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Nail my shoes, she wasn&rsquo;t far out of it.
A humpbacked porter came along with a
couple of portmanteaux, followed by a heavy
swell who was up to specification except as
to the color of his hair, which was chestnut.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;This is Mr. Grosvenor&rsquo;s carriage, sir,&rdquo;
said the porter.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, indeed. And you are Miss Millicent,
I suppose?&rdquo; said the newcomer, grinning at
Minkie.</p>

<p class="gap">&#160;</p>

<div class="figcenter bbox" style="width: 400px">
<img src="images/i013.jpg" width="400" height="630" alt="&ldquo;Oh, indeed. And you are Miss Millicent, I
suppose?&rdquo;" title="" id="i013" /></div>

<div class="gap">&nbsp;</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Are you Mr. Schwartz?&rdquo; she asked, and Dan inspected his calf, because Minkie&rsquo;s
tone told us she had taken a violent dislike
to the visitor at first sight.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he smirked, being so busy looking
at her that he paid no heed to the porter, who
was waiting for his tip.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, if you give the porter a shilling I&rsquo;ll
drive you to our place. Mother is expecting
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Are you particular as to the exact
amount?&rdquo; he inquired, still grinning. In
fact, he was one of those silly men who believe
that you must laugh when you want to
be amiable; so please imagine Mr. Schwartz
always guffawing&mdash;at least, not always, because
he could scowl very unpleasantly at
times. Tickle my withers, we made him
scowl all right before we were through with
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Minkie, giving the porter just
one little look. &ldquo;As it is Christmas time,
you might make it half a crown.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Schwartz got his hand down quick. Because
he was a rich man, he thought tuppence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>would be ample. He produced a florin, but
Minkie spotted it.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;If you haven&rsquo;t another sixpence I can
lend you one,&rdquo; she said sweetly, and I saw
Dan licking his lips when he heard her speak
in that way.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble,&rdquo; said Schwartz, rather
shortly, and he handed the porter three shillings.
That was another of his queer ways.
He liked to impress people, but cheaply. He
wanted a girl of fourteen to realize what a
grand person he was, yet he was afraid she
would spring him up to a crown, or even half
a sovereign, if he didn&rsquo;t make haste.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Minkie made room for him by her
side, and Dan hopped in too.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Is that dog yours?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And does your father permit a beast with
muddy paws to sit in his carriage?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Not often,&rdquo; said Minkie, looking at his
boots. &ldquo;Dandy, you wicked imp, get out at
once.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Dan took a header into the roadway, and ran
up alongside me, barking for all he was worth.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;Tell you what, Bob,&rdquo; he cried, nearly
choking himself with joy, &ldquo;this red-headed
Jew is going to find trouble. He is sure to
drop into the stable to-morrow. I&rsquo;ll keep
you posted in affairs inside the house, and,
when I give you the office, you&rsquo;ll let him have
both heels in the right place, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best,&rdquo; I coughed, and Jim
wondered what was the matter, as there are
no flies about in winter-time.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile, Minkie took Schwartz in hand,
and my long ears were not given me for
amusement.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;We thought you were not coming until
next week,&rdquo; she said, by way of being polite.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I finished some business in Paris sooner
than I expected, and Mr. Grosvenor was
good enough to ask me to spend Christmas
and New Year at Dale End. I shall enjoy
the visit immensely, I am sure. I have not
had a Christmas at home for many years.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;At home?&rdquo; Minkie raised her large blue
eyes so innocently. I knew exactly how she
looked, and I rattled my harness to tell her I
was listening.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes; in England, I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you call England &lsquo;home,&rsquo; too?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Of course, but I live here.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;So do I.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Sorry. I fancied you just said you had
been in some other country for a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m a bit of a cosmopolitan, I admit.
Do you know what a cosmopolitan is?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It means anything but English.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Schwartz roared. &ldquo;Gad!&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;that is not so far wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">An old gentleman passed us in a mail
phaeton, drawn by a pair of fat cobs, your
bellows-to-mend and step-short sort. They
don&rsquo;t like me, because I always make a point
of giving them the dust in summer, so one of
them snorted, &ldquo;Station hack!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Going to have a shave?&rdquo; I asked, quite
civilly, he being all of a lather.</p>

<p class="indent">Minkie gave the old gentleman a smile and
a bow. He was rather surprised, which was
reasonable enough, seeing that she usually
sails along without seeing anybody; but he
got his hat off in good time.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; inquired Schwartz.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s uncle,&rdquo; said Minkie.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Jack is a friend of yours, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Um, yes, but he&mdash;perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t
say anything about it. Jack is twenty-five,
you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, is he?&rdquo; Schwartz was not smiling
now. It was easy to guess that by his voice.
&ldquo;I suppose he is better acquainted with your
sister than with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes, heaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;What is his other name?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Percival Stanhope.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Mr. John Percival Stanhope, in fact?
Odd that I should not have heard of him, if
he is such a great friend of the family?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Dolly doesn&rsquo;t say much about him. He&rsquo;s
in India, and India is such a long way
off.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Jolly good job, too, or you would be
frizzling to-day.&rdquo; Mr. Schwartz was brightening
up again.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I think you are mistaken,&rdquo; said Minkie,
quietly. &ldquo;Jack says it is ever so cold in the
Punjab at Christmas-time.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Does he write to you, then?&rdquo; demanded
Schwartz.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No; that was in a letter to Dolly.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;A recent letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;He was talking about Christmas two years
ago. But please don&rsquo;t mention him to her.
We have no right to discuss her affairs, have
we?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No, no; of course not. It was just by
way of conversation, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;That is the cemetery,&rdquo; said Minkie,
pointing to a low tree-lined wall in the
distance. &ldquo;Some day, if you like, I shall
take you there, and show you his mother&rsquo;s
grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Thanks, but I am not fond of cemeteries,
as a rule.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Perhaps you would prefer to be cremated?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t considered the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;But you ought to. You are quite old,
nearly forty, and I saw in a pill advertisement
the other day that forty is a dangerous age if
your liver is out of order.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Here, young lady, not quite so fast, please.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>How do you know I am forty, and why do
you think I have a diseased liver?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It said so in the paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;The deuce it did.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes; in one of those little spicy bits, telling
you all about people, you know. It said:
&lsquo;Mr. Montague Schwartz is one of the Chosen
People.&rsquo; You are Mr. Montague Schwartz,
aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Go on, do.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, I remember every word &lsquo;&mdash;one of
the Chosen People&mdash;&rsquo; that means you are a
Jew, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Of Jewish descent, certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, it went on: &lsquo;His rise has been
meteoric. At twenty he quitted the paternal
fried fish shop in the Mile End Road, at
thirty he was running a saloon and other industries
at Kimberley, and at forty he is
building a mansion in Mayfair.&rsquo; There was
a lot more, but now you see how I knew your
age.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It is perfectly clear. There only remains
the liver.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I got that from the pill advertisement.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>There are several sure signs of congestion,
and you have all of them in your face and
eyes. Shall I show it to you? Those pills
might cure you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Really, you are too kind for words. May
I ask if your sister shares your knowledge
of my career and state of health?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Did I show her the paper, do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No, I had forgotten all about it, but if you
would like her to see it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Look here, Miss Millicent, you are a sharp
girl. Now, I&rsquo;ll make a bargain with you.
Find that paper, say no more about the
paragraph&mdash;which, I may tell you, is rank
nonsense from start to finish&mdash;and your
Christmas box will be five sovereigns.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; said Minkie, coolly. &ldquo;And here
we are at Dale End. Mile End&mdash;Dale End.
Funny, isn&rsquo;t it, how names run together that
way occasionally.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Before Jim led me around to the stable I
heard Mam express her surprise that Mr.
Schwartz had come alone. She had expected
her husband by the same train. And she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>did not know Millicent had gone in the victoria.
How on earth did the child recognise
Mr. Schwartz, as she had never seen him?</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I rather fancy your younger daughter
would pick me out in the Strand if she were
so minded,&rdquo; explained the visitor, cheerfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I hope she did not bore you by her chatter,&rdquo;
said dear, innocent Mam. &ldquo;Or perhaps
she was in one of her silent moods?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No. We got along famously; didn&rsquo;t we,
Millicent?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It was a nice drive,&rdquo; said Minkie, &ldquo;not
too cold, and the village is quite gay.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, I find the air rather chilly,&rdquo; said
Mam. &ldquo;Why are we all standing here?
Come into the drawing-room, Mr. Schwartz.
Dorothy is there, and we shall have tea
brought a little earlier than usual. Evangeline,
tell James to take Mr. Schwartz&rsquo;s portmanteaux
to the Blue Room.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, I should not have heard what
happened next if Tibbie had not looked in to
see me that night. As a matter of fact, the
gang does not miss much in the way of gossip.
One or other of us is always on hand. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>that parrot&mdash;though he is no friend of mine&mdash;is
a terror for picking up news. Jim hangs
his cage on a tree opposite my door every fine
morning, and the things he tells me are surprising.
He has hardly a good word for anybody,
but then, what a dull world it would
be if we only told the nice things about our
friends. Why, we should all be dumb soon.</p>

<p class="indent">Dan tried to sneak in behind Minkie, but
Mam had her eye on him.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I do believe that naughty Dandy has been
in the wars again,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Millicent, did
you see him fighting any other dog?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No, mother. He met the doctor&rsquo;s poodle,
but there was no fight.&rdquo; Minkie was always
strictly accurate.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;What a wonder! Anyhow, he is muddy
and wet. Ask cook to rub him over with a
damp cloth.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Tibbie, pretending to be asleep, twitched
one ear as she saw Dan being led off to the
kitchen. &ldquo;Gnar!&rdquo; muttered Dan, who hates
damp cloths, &ldquo;wait till I catch you in the
garden!&rdquo; Tibbie just smiled. I must say
that cats take life easily; they are given the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>best of everything, and do nothing. A friend
of mine, a regular old stager, who pulls near
in the Black Lion bus, tells me that Tibbie&rsquo;s
method is the only way to get on, and he sees
a lot of different people at the inn, so he ought
to be a bit of a philosopher. &ldquo;Make other
people work for you,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
ticket; when they bring you chaff tell &rsquo;em you
must have oats, an&rsquo; snap their heads off if
they don&rsquo;t move quick enough. Bless your
hoof, they like it. You hear &rsquo;em say:
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s blood for you, a born aristocrat, he
is,&rsquo; an&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll do any mortal thing you want.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Well, Tibbie curled up like a hedgehog,
and listened, because we don&rsquo;t have many
strangers at Dale End. The talk turned on
Ostend&mdash;no, it&rsquo;s as true as I&rsquo;m standing on
four legs, but the very first place mentioned
had an &ldquo;end&rdquo; in it&mdash;where the Old Man
and Mam and Dorothy had been in the
summer. Minkie had measles, or something
spotty, so she was forbidden to travel, and we
had a ripping July all to ourselves. Eclipse
wasn&rsquo;t in it; why, I had beer every day.
They met Mr. Schwartz at Ostend, it seems,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>and he took such a fancy to Dolly that he
wanted to marry her straight off. She
wouldn&rsquo;t do that, even if Mam and the Guv&rsquo;nor
were agreeable, but she had not heard
from Jack for ages, and Schwartz was really
very attentive, besides being tremendously
rich. Now, we at Dale End find it difficult
to pay the hay and corn bills, so you see that
a wealthy son-in-law would be what the sale
catalogues call &ldquo;a desirable acquisition.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">I have heard a lot of people in the village
say that Dolly is so pretty she ought to make
a good match. When she did a skirt dance
at the Cottage Hospital Bazaar, the local
paper spoke of her as &ldquo;the beautiful Miss
Grosvenor.&rdquo; She pretended to be very angry
about that, but Tibbie says she bought a
dozen papers and sent them to her girl friends,
so the rest of the report must have been suitable.
I suppose she is all right for a grownup.
For my part, I prefer Minkie, who has
a yellow mane, and blue eyes, and freckles.
She is as straight as a soldier, and has small
hands and feet, and the loveliest brown legs....
Eh, what? Well, say stockings, then,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>but when I took first prize and the cup for
the best hackney in the show, everybody
admired my legs; so why not Minkie&rsquo;s?</p>

<p class="indent">Anyhow, by the time tea was served,
Schwartz had further established himself in
Mam&rsquo;s good graces. He was a clever chap
in his way, and he could say the right thing
to women occasionally, and he was wise
enough not to bother Dorothy too much,
though Tibbie saw, out of the tail of her eye,
that the girl could not move from one side of
the room to the other without Schwartz&rsquo;s
watching her approvingly. Tibbie knew by
his eyes that he was saying to himself:
&ldquo;She will look all right in Brook-street.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Dan announced the postman while Dorothy
was pouring out the tea, and Minkie brought
in a heap of letters, mostly Christmas cards.
Minkie had a baker&rsquo;s dozen to herself, and
five of them were addressed to &ldquo;Minkie and
her Gang&rdquo;; each of the five contained pictures
of a girl, a horse, a dog, a cat, and a
parrot. She soon made out by the postmark
and the handwriting who had sent every card,
even though the names were not given. One
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>seemed to puzzle her at first, and she slipped
it into her pocket. The others were handed
round, before Dorothy arranged them on the
mantel-piece with a number which had come
by earlier deliveries, and Mr. Schwartz admired
them immensely.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It is so interesting to come back to the old
country and find these pleasant customs in
full swing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have neither sent
nor received a Christmas card for years. I
was telling Millicent on our way from the
station that, by chance, I have been out of England
at this season every year for ten years.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You did not mention the exact period, Mr.
Schwartz,&rdquo; said Minkie. &ldquo;I rather thought
that ten years ago you were in Kimberley?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, one speaks in round numbers. By
the way, have you received a card from your
elderly friend&mdash;the man we met driving
the pair?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Driving a pair. Who was that, Millie?&rdquo;
asked her mother.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Mr. Stanhope, Jack&rsquo;s uncle.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Dorothy dropped a piece of toast, and Mam
bent over her letters, but she said quietly:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I fear my girls will not be honored by any
such attention on his part, Mr. Schwartz.
Indeed, I think he is the only enemy we possess
in the neighborhood. How did you come
to describe him as a friend of yours,
Millie?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Perhaps I was mistaken,&rdquo; put in Schwartz,
who was beginning to hate Minkie, yet had
no wish to quarrel with her.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I said Jack was my friend. Isn&rsquo;t that
right, mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, yes. I understand now. By the
way, dearie, are you going to meet your
father? It is nearly time to start. And be
careful to wrap up well.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;The victoria will not be ready for another
five minutes. I have time to bring you that
paper if you would care to see it before dinner,
Mr. Schwartz.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Thanks. I shall be delighted&mdash;you
wretched little imp,&rdquo; he added under his
breath, but Tibbie heard him.</p>

<p class="indent">Minkie brought the paper.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;That is the paragraph I told you of,&rdquo; said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>she, pointing very daintily to something on
one of the pages. I have seen her point that
way to a dead rat when she wished Jim or
Mole to throw it away.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Much obliged. And here are the five
sovereigns I promised you as a Christmas
box.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Mr. Schwartz&mdash;&rdquo; broke in Mam, but he
turned to her with his best manner.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I beg of you to allow me to do this, Mrs.
Grosvenor. It is really a harmless joke
between Millicent and myself,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;But five pounds&mdash;&rdquo; protested Mam.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;That was in the bond. Pray let me explain.
By chance, she mentioned some very
useful information which this newspaper contained;
I might not have heard of it otherwise.
So I am adding a little to her Christmas
present&mdash;that is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It seems a great deal of money,&rdquo; sighed
Mam, who often wanted a fiver and had to
do without it, &ldquo;but you two appear to have
the matter cut and dried, so I suppose it is all
right. What are you going to do with your
fabulous wealth, Millicent?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;Make a corner in toffee. Make every kid
in Dale End pay a penny for a ha&rsquo;penny-worth.
That is the proper thing, isn&rsquo;t it,
Mr. Schwartz?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can teach you much,&rdquo; he
replied with his usual grin.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh yes, you can. Read the next paragraph,
the one beginning: &lsquo;The unhappy
natives of the Upper Niger.&rsquo; It tells about
gas-pipe guns and coal-dust powder. Yes,
mother dear, going now.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">It was quite dark, of course, when I brought
Minkie to the station a second time. The
weather had changed, too, from what the
farmers call &ldquo;soft&rdquo; to a touch of frost, which
made both Jim and me pleased that my shoes
had been sharped by the blacksmith that
morning.</p>

<p class="indent">The train was rather late, so Minkie went
into the station and interviewed a porter.
He told her something which seemed to interest
her, so she asked the booking-clerk for
change of a sovereign and gave the man a
shilling.</p>

<p class="indent">She picked out her father the instant the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>train drew up at the platform. He looked
worried, she told me afterwards, but that
passed when he saw her. He had the usual
number of parcels which people carry at
Christmas time, and Minkie grabbed all of
them, but he stopped her with a laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t rush off in the orthodox way
to-night, Minkie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mr. Schwartz&rsquo;s
servant is on this train, and I promised to
take him with us to the house. By the way,
is Dandy with you in the carriage?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No, father dear. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Because this valet of Schwartz&rsquo;s is a black
man, and Dandy might not approve of him
at first sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;A black man.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes, polished ebony. Rather smart, too.
Speaks English perfectly. He came to me at
Waterloo and said&mdash;Oh, there he is. Hi,
you. Just follow me, will you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Minkie thought that the negro was an extraordinarily
fine fellow, and very well dressed.
It was odd that Schwartz had not mentioned
him, and she wondered where he would
sleep. Perhaps he curled up on a mat outside
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>his master&rsquo;s room. In that case, she
must make Dan clearly understand that she
rather approved of the Ethiopian than otherwise.</p>

<p class="indent">His luggage appeared to be a small handbag.
He almost made the mistake of entering
the carriage with Minkie and her father,
but he showed his teeth in a good-natured
grin, and climbed to Jim&rsquo;s side on the box.
I had a look at him as he passed the near
lamp, and he certainly did startle me; I am
quite sure I should have shifted him if Minkie
had not said quietly:</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;All right, Bobby. Steady, old chap.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">On the way home I heard Minkie trying to
cheer up her father by telling him little bits
of village news, and he did his best to respond,
but both of us felt there was something
wrong, as the Guv&rsquo;nor is likely enough
most days.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Mr. Schwartz has arrived, of course?&rdquo;
he inquired, soon after we quitted the station.&ldquo;I forgot to ask
you sooner. I took it for granted when his servant turned up and told
me he had missed the earlier train.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes. He came according to your telegram.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;How has he got on at home?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, first rate. Mam and Dolly seemed
quite pleased to see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;What do <i>you</i> think of him, Minkie?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I hardly know yet, father dear. I shall
tell you&mdash;let me see&mdash;on New Year&rsquo;s Eve.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You demand seven days&rsquo; experience, eh?
Wise child. I wish some one had taught me
at your age to wait a bit before I formed my
opinions.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;One might form them quickly enough,
but not express them.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Which means that you don&rsquo;t like
Schwartz? Well, he is not exactly my sort,
I admit, but he is wealthy, Minkie, and one
must bow the knee before the golden calf
occasionally. And his repute stands high in
the city, so he might be a useful friend. We
must make the best of him, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;One always does that with one&rsquo;s guests,
of course,&rdquo; said Minkie, who could feel a
heavy assortment of gold and silver coins in
her pocket.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>
<p class="indent">Minkie jumped out when I pulled up at
the front entrance. Dan was standing on
the top step and wondering what in the
world was sitting beside Jim on the box.
Before he could say a word, Minkie grabbed
him and whispered in his ear. But he was
very uneasy, because the black man sprang
down almost as promptly as Minkie, and
nearly frightened Evangeline into a fit when
she met him in the hall. He took his hat off
in quite an elegant way.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I am Mr. Schwartz&rsquo;s valet,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Mr. Grosvenor was good enough to bring
me with him from London. Is my master in
his room now?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;N-no, sir,&rdquo; stuttered Evangeline. He
gave her the queerest feeling, she told Cookie
later.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, if you will kindly show me to his
suite I will prepare his clothes for dinner,&rdquo;
went on the negro, who appeared to be more
anxious to get to work than any of our servants.</p>

<p class="indent">Evangeline glanced at Minkie and the
Guv&rsquo;nor; she was sure it must be all right, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>the negro had arrived in their company, but
she dared not go upstairs with him. Wild
horses would not drag her there, she said,
though I would back myself to haul her to
the top attic before she could say &ldquo;knife.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Blue Room,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;First on
the left in that corridor,&rdquo; and she pointed to
the side of the house where Mr. Schwartz
was lodged. The big darky went up at
once. Evangeline helped to carry in some
of the parcels, and Minkie took her father&rsquo;s
overcoat and hat, but kept an eye on Dan,
who was looking at the stairs anxiously.
Dolly came running to kiss the Old Man, and
Mam appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Where is Mr. Schwartz?&rdquo; asked the
Guv&rsquo;nor.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; said Schwartz, appearing in
the drawing-room doorway. &ldquo;I am afraid
you had a cold journey from town. It was
exceedingly kind of you to send me on ahead.
My only regret is that you could not come
with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Business, my dear fellow. It pursues me
to the last hour, even in holiday time.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;But that is good. It argues success.
Your idle man is rarely successful.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I fear it is possible for a busy man to score
a loss occasionally. I expect you have finished
tea long since? Can you squeeze the pot,
Mam?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It will be here in a minute, Tom,&rdquo; said
Mam, smiling. &ldquo;My husband hates to miss
his tea, Mr. Schwartz. He would drink three
cups now if I were to let him, though we dine
at seven.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;By the way, that reminds me,&rdquo; said the
Old Man, dropping into his regular chair in
the drawing-room. &ldquo;I fell in with your servant
at Waterloo, Schwartz.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;My servant!&rdquo; said Schwartz, blankly, and
both Dan and Tibbie heard every word, as
Minkie had collected Dan again before she
took her usual perch on a hassock near her
father. If the Guv&rsquo;nor had said he came
across Schwartz&rsquo;s balloon at the Southwestern
terminus our visitor could not have put
more bewilderment into his voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes, your black valet,&rdquo; explained the
Guv&rsquo;nor.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;My black valet! I don&rsquo;t possess such an
article. I left my man at Brook-street, and
he is a Frenchman.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Schwartz had risen to his feet. He looked
strangely pale&mdash;Minkie told me his face was
a flea-bitten grey. The Guv&rsquo;nor jumped up,
too. So did Minkie, and Dan, and Tibbie.
You see, Mam and Dorothy knew nothing
about the gentleman who had gone to
Schwartz&rsquo;s bedroom to arrange his dress suit
and put the studs in his shirt.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Then who the blazes is the nigger who is
in your room upstairs at this moment?&rdquo; said
the Old Man, forgetting that there were
ladies present.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Nigger! My room!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Schwartz&rsquo;s voice cracked. He gasped as
though he had run a mile. He glared at the
Guv&rsquo;nor and then glared at Minkie. Stifle
me, he thought it was some trick she had
played on him. But if the head of our family
was not much good at business he was in the
front row where prompt action was needed.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Follow me, quick!&rdquo; he shouted, and made
for the door. He was just a second too late.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>The tall negro was coming downstairs three
at a time. He bounded across the hall and
had his hand on the latch just as the Guv&rsquo;nor
rushed at him. Out went the black, out went
Mr. Grosvenor after him, with Minkie and
Dan a dead heat half a length behind, and
Schwartz whipping in. On the level the
nigger drew away; but Dan overhauled him
at the turn near the clump of rhododendrons,
and Dan never makes the mistake of advertising
his whereabouts when the matter is
serious. So he nailed the make-believe valet
by the ankle, and his teeth closed on bone
and sinew without ever a sound. Down went
the nigger with a crash and a yell. It was
pitch dark among the shrubs, but the Old
Man groped for him and got a knee in the
small of his back, bending his head upwards
at the same time by grabbing a handful of
wool. That is a good trick. It simply
paralyses the other fellow.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got him,&rdquo; he shouted, but Schwartz
just roared &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; at the top of his voice,
and kept to the open drive. Minkie heard
Dan sawing away, and growling a bit, now;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>she closed in, clutched a loose leg that was
kicking wildly, and said:</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Are you all right, dad?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes. Tell James to fetch a stable lantern
and a rope.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Minkie wasn&rsquo;t going to leave her father
nor miss any of the fun. She sung out directions,
and Jim came along at a gallop. The
unfortunate nigger was screaming that the
dog was eating him, but, when they had tied
his hands behind his back, and Minkie pulled
Dan off, he seemed to be more frightened
than hurt. Polly told me next day that these
black fellows are always weak below the knee
joints, however gigantic they may be otherwise.</p>

<p class="indent">But the previous excitement was a small
affair compared with the row which sprang
up when Jim held the lantern so that Schwartz
could see the negro&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Gott in himmel!&rdquo; he shrieked, in a kind
of frenzy, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Prince John.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes&mdash;you thief!&rdquo; said the prisoner, who
seemed to regain his self-possession and his
dignity when he set eyes on Schwartz.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;Where is it? Where is it? Give it to
me, or I&rsquo;ll tear your liver out!&rdquo; squealed the
other, dancing close up to him in an extraordinary
passion, being one of those men
who fly into a delirium when rage gets the
better of them.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I have not got it,&rdquo; said Prince John, if
that was his name. He turned to the Guv&rsquo;nor.
&ldquo;If you will take me back to the house, Mr.
Grosvenor,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and keep that
dog off, I will explain everything, and trust
to your sense of justice to clear me of any
suspicion of wrong-doing. That man is the
thief, not me,&rdquo; and he actually spat at Schwartz.</p>

<p class="indent">Jim said that it gave him a turn to hear a
buck nigger talking like that, but it took him
and the Guv&rsquo;nor all their time to keep
Schwartz from using his nails on the man&rsquo;s
eyes. Then the two began to shout at one
another, and it appeared that all the trouble
arose about a thing called a ju-ju, which the
black man said Schwartz had stolen from his
people, a tribe on the Upper Niger. Anyhow,
the Guv&rsquo;nor marched his captive back to the
house, and Schwartz rushed upstairs. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>tore down again, more like a lunatic than ever,
as the ju-ju had gone from the dressing-case
in which he had left it.</p>

<p class="indent">He searched the negro, and was almost
ready to cut him open in case he had swallowed
it, but the ju-ju was not in the man&rsquo;s
possession. Then he went out with Jim and
the lantern, and hunted every inch of the
drive and shrubbery, but could find nothing,
though it was easy enough to discover the
place where Dan had brought down his highness.</p>

<p class="indent">The odd thing was that he refused to send
for the police, and the more certain it became
that the ju-ju was missing, the more jubilant
grew Prince John&rsquo;s face as he sat in the hall.
At last, there was nothing for it but the nigger
must be set at liberty. Schwartz wanted the
Guv&rsquo;nor to lock him up all night. Of course,
that could not be done, as Surrey isn&rsquo;t West
Africa, and the Old Man had come to the
conclusion that there was not much in the
dispute between them, anyhow.</p>

<p class="indent">So Prince John&rsquo;s bonds were untied, and
the Guv&rsquo;nor told him if he showed his black
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>muzzle inside our gateway again he would
be locked up. He was very polite and apologetic,
especially to the ladies, and the house
party went in to dinner greatly mystified by the
whole affair. Schwartz did not say much,
and his appetite was spoiled. After dinner
he had another hunt in his bedroom and
among the shrubs, but finally he gave up the
search until daylight, and came in and asked
for a whisky and soda.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile, Minkie brought Dan to the
stable to see me. She came the back way,
and climbed to the hay-loft with Jim&rsquo;s lantern.
Dan began to look around for a rat, but she
stopped him.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Are you awake, Bobby?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Awake!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I should rather think
I am, after such goings on in the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, pulling a small black bag
from among the hay, &ldquo;if you are a good horse,
and listen carefully, I will now tell you what
a ju-ju is. Come here, Dan. If it is alive, I
may want you to bite it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Skin me and sell my hide, what do you
think it was? Just a small chunk of ivory,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>carved to represent a man with a monkey&rsquo;s
head. It had a little coat of colored beads
tied where its waist was meant to be, and its
eyes were two shiny green stones. And that
was all.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried Minkie, &ldquo;this <i>is</i> a surprise.
At first sight, I don&rsquo;t think much of a ju-ju,
but that may be only my beastly ignorance,
as the man said when he tried to boil a china
egg.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ph3">PRINCE JOHN&rsquo;S STRANGE ALLY</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>Told by Dandy, the Terrier</i></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> MADE a mistake once, and nipped a
tramp&rsquo;s wooden leg. Since then, I look
before I take hold. But even a poodle could
see that this thing was old bone, though its
eyes glinted like Tibbie&rsquo;s in the dark, and there was a smell of grease about its beaded
kilt. And, talking of kilts, there&rsquo;s a bare-legged
fellow who comes here every summer
and struts up and down the road, making the
beastliest row with some sort of instrument
all pipes and ribbons. Wow! don&rsquo;t I change
his tune if I get out before anybody can catch
me!</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a baby&rsquo;s toy,&rdquo; said I, seeing that
Minkie was rather taken with it.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look,&rdquo; said a voice I hated,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>and Tibbie walked up Bobby&rsquo;s neck, and
perched between his ears.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; cried I, in my most sarcastic
snarl, &ldquo;are you there? And what is this acrobatic
business? Is it a circus, or what?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Speak when you&rsquo;re spoken to,&rdquo; spat
Tibbie. &ldquo;And let me give you fair warning
that the next time you sneak any meat off my
skewer I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, shut up, both of you,&rdquo; commanded
Minkie; so I just pretended to lick my lips,
though I really care very little for the rather
high stuff that cats make such a song about.
I like mine underdone.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Have you ever before heard of a ju-ju,
Bob?&rdquo; went on Minkie.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bob. He didn&rsquo;t shake his head,
because Tibbie was there, and she has a nasty
habit of hanging on with her claws before you
can say &ldquo;Rats!&rdquo; Why do cats have such
sharp nails, anyhow? They used to scar my
muzzle something awful before I learnt to
jump on them feet first. But they can&rsquo;t bite
for nuts. If they could, I must admit&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I think <i>I</i> might tell you something about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>it,&rdquo; broke in Tibbie, backing down Bob&rsquo;s
mane and settling on his withers again.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, go on,&rdquo; said Minkie, bending a bit,
so as to watch Tibbie&rsquo;s green eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long time ago since I had the story
from a blue Persian.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Cookie has some liver in the larder.&rdquo;
You see, Minkie knew her cat.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Has she? I was out when the butcher
came.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s liver and bacon for breakfast
in the morning. And <span class="smcap">SOLES</span>!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">P-r-r-r, you could feel Tibbie&rsquo;s fur rising.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to remember,&rdquo; she said in a rather
thick voice. &ldquo;It seems that we cats used to
be worshipped by the ancient Egyptians. The
cat deity was named Elurus, and we were also
venerated as a symbol of the moon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">I couldn&rsquo;t help it. Even Bob coughed, and
then pretended to be chewing hay. But, because
I laughed, Minkie clouted my ear.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;The Romans always placed a cat at the
feet of the Goddess of Liberty; they realized
that no animal resists the loss of its freedom
so furiously as a cat,&rdquo; continued Tibbie in her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>best purr. &ldquo;That is why you never see a cat
wearing a collar, the badge of servitude, like a
dog.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Wow! I&rsquo;ll give her &ldquo;servitude&rdquo; next time I
have a chance. &ldquo;Like a dog!&rdquo; indeed.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;What has all this got to do with a ju-ju?&rdquo;
asked Minkie.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I am coming to that. The Egyptians were
a very wise people, obviously, and their ways
were sure to be copied by the black men who
lived near them. They thought so much of
cats that whoever killed one, even accidentally,
was punished by death. This cat-headed god,
Elurus, had a human body, and his image
brought luck and good fortune to those who
carried it about with them. Now, there are
no cats where the black men live, but there
are plenty of monkeys, so I am just guessing.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Minkie, quite seriously.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Regarding that fish and liver?&rdquo; cried
Tibbie, trying to talk in an off-hand way.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I am going to interview Cookie now,&rdquo; was
the reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Hold on! Where do <i>I</i> come in?&rdquo; I
simply had to interfere. The thing was an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>outrage. Fancy getting fish and liver for a
blue-mouldy yarn like that.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And me?&rdquo; snorted Bob.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re both too fat already,&rdquo; said Minkie
calmly, but she kicked down another lot of
hay before she blew the lantern out, and I got
a snack of steak while Tibbie was filling up
on fish heads and <i>foie de veau</i>. I lapped the
best part of her milk, too, when she wasn&rsquo;t
looking.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a keen frost that night, and the
scent of the nigger, not to mention some
beery singers who call themselves &ldquo;the waits,&rdquo;
kept me awake for hours. Every man has a
different smell, though some folk get mad if
you tell them so, but the Upper Niger tang
was new to me, and I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking
what a place that must be for a hunt if even a
well-washed black prince left such a <i>bouquet</i>
behind him. I suppose you are surprised to
hear a fox-terrier using French words, but I
learnt them from Mademoiselle, Minkie&rsquo;s
governess, who went away last month.</p>

<p class="indent">Next morning, at breakfast, all the talk was
of Prince John and the ju-ju. Schwartz had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>hunted high and low for his doll, but, considering
that it was in Minkie&rsquo;s pocket, he was not
likely to find it. If only he had a nose like
me he would soon have been on its track.
I fancied the Guv&rsquo;nor was not altogether
pleased that such a rough-and-tumble performance
should have taken place at Holly
Lodge on a Christmas Eve, and Schwartz was
so put out by the loss of the ju-ju that it cast
rather a gloom over the household&mdash;excepting
Minkie, Tibbie and me, of course. As
for that fool of a parrot, he, or she&mdash;blessed
if I can tell one parrot from another, but this
one never lays an egg, though everyone calls
him &ldquo;Polly&rdquo;&mdash;well, he was nearly delirious
with excitement, because Christmas time
brings nuts into his cage. Once the conversation
came pretty close to our little secret.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;By the way, Millicent, that negro had a
black bag in his hand when he drove home
with us last night, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; inquired the
Old Man, tackling Minkie rather suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, yes, father dear. I saw it quite
plainly. Did he take it upstairs, Evangeline?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;I dunno, miss. He fair flummaxed me,
he did, with his bowin&rsquo; and scrapin&rsquo; an, lah-di-dah
manners. As I said to Cook&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;That will do, Evangeline,&rdquo; put in Mam.
&ldquo;Bring some more toast, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Minkie had steered the question off smartly,
but the Guv&rsquo;nor stuck to his point.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;There can be no doubt the rascal brought
the bag into the house. I remember now
seeing him carry it into the hall. Yet it was
not in his possession when we caught him in
the garden, and it must have been found if it
were lying among the shrubs, or he had left
it in the house. By Jove! Is it possible that
he had an accomplice? Really, Schwartz,
you ought to have called in the police if the
matter is so serious.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;This quarrel is between Prince John and
myself,&rdquo; said Schwartz, sullenly. &ldquo;He may
have had others to help, though it is difficult
to see how that could be, under the circumstances.
But this is only the second
round of a big fight. He and I will meet
again, probably on a certain island in the
Niger which we both know well. Then we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>shall settle the ownership of that small god,
for keeps.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Dolly, &ldquo;is it an idol?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Schwartz tried to pull himself together.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No, Miss Dorothy, not an idol, but a
fetish,&rdquo; he said, with his usual grin. &ldquo;The
fact is, I fear I have led you to believe that I
attach an exaggerated value to it. It is only
a bit of carved ivory, which the natives regard
as a talisman. But it had a sentimental interest
for me, much as a gambler at Monte
Carlo might prize a champagne cork, or a
piece of coal, or some equally ridiculous
charm which he had carried in his pocket on
the night of a big <i>coup</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Me-ow!&rdquo; said Tibbie, looking up at Minkie.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes, darling,&rdquo; said Minkie, &ldquo;the dish is
going out now, and I have told cook to save
you the tit-bits. Dan, come back here! Who
stole Tibbie&rsquo;s milk last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;<i>Misre de Dieu!</i>&rdquo; as mademoiselle said
when she was turning over the strawberry
plants and grabbed a wasp&mdash;who split on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>me? Was it Evangeline? Wait till I catch
her sliding down to the front gate to-night
when her young man whistles &ldquo;Annie
Rooney.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll raise the house.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I suppose you had some lively times occasionally
in West Africa, Schwartz?&rdquo; said the
Old Man cheerfully, his idea being to swing
the talk away from a topic which his guest
seemed to avoid.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Y-yes, for a few minutes every now and
then. But the excitement soon passed. For
the rest, it was deadly dull, a sort of slow crescendo
up to the boiling point of fever, and a
gradual diminuendo back to flabby health
again. It is no country for a white man, unless
he wants his relations to collect his life
insurance.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yet you made money there?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, yes. Why else should one go to such
a filthy swamp?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Do you mean to say that the natives of a
fever-laden district are physically up to the
standard of the fellow we collared last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No; he comes from the highlands, where
the country is altogether different. But the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>money is made at the ports and trading stations.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Any sport?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Very little, the bush is too dense.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Then why do the blacks want gas-pipe
guns and coal-dust gunpowder?&rdquo; asked Minkie,
who was making a jam sandwich.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;To shoot the whites,&rdquo; replied Schwartz.
&ldquo;So you see it would be bad for our health if
the traders gave them good weapons and ammunition.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;That explains it,&rdquo; said Minkie.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Explains what, dear?&rdquo; inquired Mam,
and Schwartz squirmed a bit until Minkie
said:</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Something I read in a paper, mother.
These wicked negroes pay high prices for
rifles, and of course it is best to let them believe
they are buying the genuine article.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Mam was puzzled, but the Guv&rsquo;nor laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I am glad to hear
that one member of the family has grasped
the true principles of commercial success.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know where Millicent
gets her ideas from,&rdquo; sighed Mam. &ldquo;When
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>I was her age I could no more have said such
a thing than I could have flown.&ldquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And you certainly were never built for
flying, less now than ever,&rdquo; smiled her husband.
Of course, I paid little heed to all this
chaff, because I was bolting half that jam
sandwich, which Minkie had dropped. Evangeline
saw what happened, and said nothing,
so it will be &ldquo;Whistle and I&rsquo;ll come to you, my
lad,&rdquo; to-night. But I woke up to the sounds
of battle when Mam wanted to know who
was going to church. Everybody said &ldquo;I,&rdquo;
except Schwartz, who had letters to write.
You ought to have watched his face when
Minkie said quietly:</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;In that case you will miss seeing Jack
Stanhope, the friend of whom I was telling
you yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Jack! Is he at home?&rdquo; Dolly blurted out,
and then blushed right down her neck.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes. Didn&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;How could I? If it comes to that, how
do you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;He sent me a Christmas picture postcard
last evening, one of the new ones, with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>season&rsquo;s wishes and a lot of robins on one side
and a ha-penny stamp with the address and a
little bit of a letter on the other. Here it is.
Shall I read it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Guv&rsquo;nor rather grimly.
Outside the gang, he understood Minkie
better than anybody else, and he evidently
wondered why she was making such a dead
set against Schwartz.</p>

<p class="indent">Minkie produced the card from the pocket
which held the ju-ju. It was a deep pocket,
lengthened by herself; she often needed it to
hide a young rabbit when I had induced one
to leave his home and friends, because keepers
make a beastly fuss about these small matters
if they hear of them.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It has the West Strand postmark, 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>,
December 24th,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and this is what
he writes: &lsquo;Dear Minkie: Just arrived from
Marseilles, ex s.s. Persia. It was enough to
freeze Dan&rsquo;s tail off crossing the Channel, but
I am glad to be here early, as I can do a bit
of shopping (being in need of decoration)
before I run down to Dale End. I shall be
strolling past the Lodge about six o&rsquo;clock,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>and will be delighted if you are visible. Otherwise,
we shall meet at Church to-morrow,
and exchange winks if Grampus is there too.
Yours ever, Jack. P.S. I have brought you
a pet mongoose.&rsquo; That is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Quite enough, too. May I ask who
&lsquo;Grampus&rsquo; is?&rdquo; said her father.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;His uncle. Jack depends on him for his
allowance, so he has to humor him, but he
never agreed with him about that shooting
squabble, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I know nothing about his views, and care
less, and I do not wish you to exchange either
postcards or winks with him or any of his
name.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; put in Mam, gently, &ldquo;this is Christmas
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I have not forgotten that, my dear. Nor
have I forgotten this day two years ago, when
the other Stanhope ignored my proffered hand
before a dozen of our mutual acquaintances.
You hear, Millicent? I have spoken.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes, father dear, but it is such a pity about
the mongoose. And I had a new word I
wanted to surprise Jack with. Christmas
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>picture postcard is such a mouthful, so I
intended to call it a Chris-card. Don&rsquo;t you
think that rather neat?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I do, but it is not comparable to the neatness
with which you draw a red herring across
the scent. Of course, if he sends you the mongoose,
you may keep it, and write a civil note
of thanks, but we can hardly indulge in a close
friendship with the nephew when the uncle
cannot find a good word to say for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">I was that delighted that I scraped Minkie&rsquo;s
leg to tell her I was underneath the table. A
mongoose coming to join the family! What
<i>is</i> a mongoose, anyhow? Has it four legs, or
two? Can it fight? I must have murmured
my thoughts aloud, because the parrot gave
a screech that made Schwartz jump.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Go and hide in the nearest rabbit burrow,
little dog,&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;Run away and bury
yourself with a bone. When that mongoose
turns up he&rsquo;ll chase you into the next parish.
Oh, Christopher! Aren&rsquo;t we havin&rsquo; a beano?
Another rum &rsquo;ot, please, miss.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">I kept my temper. There is no use arguing
with a parrot. You can&rsquo;t get at him, and he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>has an amazing variety of language at command;
but I must state one small point in his
favor; if you pay no heed to his vulgarity,
and cut out of his talk the silly bits which
seem to please people who wear clothes, he
gives one a lot of useful information. He will
not say a word in a friendly way, same as I
give even Tibbie the nod if there&rsquo;s a mouse
in the kitchen. The best plan is to sauce him,
or sneer at him. Then he flies into a rage and
talks like a book.</p>

<p class="indent">So, &ldquo;Polly,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you shouldn&rsquo;t strain
your voice in that fashion. It will make your
feet ache.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">He knew what I meant well enough, because
just then he was hanging head downwards
from his perch. He reached out and took a
grip of a steel bar in his beak, pretending he
had hold of me by the neck.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;If I were you I&rsquo;d whitewash my face in
the hope that the mongoose would not recognize
me after the first round,&rdquo; he croaked.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I believe you are afraid of the thing yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Say not so, whiskers. Kiss me, mother,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>kiss your darling. A full-grown mongoose
will make you the sickest dog in the British
Isles. Whoop at him, Boxer! Back to him,
Bendigo! O my sainted aunt, I&rsquo;ll watch
that snake-catcher chuck you into the lake.
Nah, then, who&rsquo;ll tike odds. I&rsquo;ll back the
fee-ald. The fee-ald a powney!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Evangeline,&rdquo; said Mam, &ldquo;put the green
cloth over that bird. He grows worse daily,
and I cannot make out where he learns so
much cockney slang.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Minkie kicked me under the table. She
guessed I had been teasing him. At any rate,
the parrot clearly expected to witness a first-rate
set-to when the mongoose arrived. In his
own mind he had already taken a ticket for
the front row of the stalls, and I meant to
oblige him with a star turn. A mongoose may
be able to catch a snake, but he must not put
on airs with a dog who killed thirty rats in one
minute the last time Farmer Hodson threshed
his barley stack.</p>

<p class="indent">I heard Schwartz telling Dolly that he had
changed his mind and would go to church, so
at half-past ten they walked off to the village.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>It was quite warm in the sun, but the air was
nippy, so I gave Tib a run across the lawn
when I found her stalking a sparrow; then I
went round to see Bob. He was busy eating.
I suppose a horse has to get through a lot of
hay before he fills up. Hay is dry stuff at the
best. I like an odd snack between meals myself,
but the only chew worth considering is
something you can load in quickly before any
other fellow has a chance of grabbing it.</p>

<p class="indent">Anyhow, when I asked Bob what a mongoose
was, he was rather short, and said he
had no time for riddles, as he had been dreaming
of niggers all night.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;hay makes you
nervous. It must be like tea. Cookie says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Bob gave his horse laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Cookie calls it &lsquo;tea,&rsquo; does she?&rdquo; he roared.
&ldquo;You give her my compliments and ask her to
draw some of that tea for me in a jug. Tib
knows where the barrel is.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">So I trotted back to Polly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;tell me what a
mongoose is, and I&rsquo;ll nick some grapes for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>
<p class="indent">He was singing &ldquo;Hello, my baby,&rdquo; but he
stopped.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ichneumon,&rdquo; he answered. That
nettled me.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Anything like a cockatoo?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a low-bred cur,&rdquo; he screamed, &ldquo;an
ignorant mongrel. You shouldn&rsquo;t seek information.
What you want is a ticket for the
Dogs&rsquo; Home. Help! Help!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Why, you hook-nosed nut-cracker, what&rsquo;s
the good of telling anybody that a mongoose
is an ichneumon? How would you like it
if I said you were a zygodactyl?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">He nearly had a fit. His language brought
Evangeline from the attic: she thought the
house was on fire. The fact is, Minkie dug
that word out of the dictionary, and I&rsquo;ve been
waiting for an opportunity to hand it on to
Polly; now he has had it, fair between the
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">I heard afterwards that if affairs were
lively at Holly Lodge it was not all peace and
goodwill to men at the parish church. Grampus
had an attack of gout&mdash;a day earlier than
usual&mdash;so Jack went to Christmas service
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>alone. He winked twice at Minkie, but she
gazed at him steadily with the only eye he
could see. Dolly was entirely taken up with
her prayer-book, so Jack took careful stock
of the red-haired man with the map of Judea
in his face. But a captain of hussars who has
won the D. S. O. has no reason to be ashamed
of being alive, so, when our people came
through the lych gate, there was Captain
Stanhope with his hat off, smiling quite
pleasantly, and wishing them the compliments
of the season.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, Mam and the Guv&rsquo;nor, being
gentlefolk, had to respond. Schwartz made
to walk on with Dolly, but she stopped, too,
and Minkie shook hands with Jack first of
anybody.</p>

<p class="indent">The old man was hardly comfortable; he
nudged Mam&rsquo;s arm, and they would have
joined Schwartz if Jack hadn&rsquo;t said:</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;By the way, Mr. Grosvenor, I want to
have a chat with you on a matter of some importance.
Can you spare me a few minutes
now, or shall I call later in the day?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Dolly blushed, and her father saw it. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>stiffened a bit, just as I do when my hair
rises.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I am sorry, Captain Stanhope, but I fear
that any exchange of confidences between us
will not only be useless but open to misinterpretation,&rdquo;
he said coldly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Let me explain that I am running dead
against my uncle&rsquo;s wishes in seeking this interview,&rdquo;
protested Jack. &ldquo;Believe me, I am
actuated by the best of good feeling towards
you and your family, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I do credit that; but any discussion of the
point must inflict unnecessary pain.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;This is really a serious matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;So is everything where your uncle and I
are concerned. Come on, my dear. We cannot
keep Mr. Schwartz waiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">The Guv&rsquo;nor lifted his hat and marched
away. Mam said nothing, Dolly didn&rsquo;t care
tuppence how her skirt draped, Minkie said that
if the frost continued there would soon be thick
ice, and Schwartz grinned. Dolly thought she
would like to slap Schwartz, so she joined
Minkie on the high path above the road, where
the hens have to fly when I get after them.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s too bad of father to snub Jack
in that way,&rdquo; she said, half sobbing.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Dad is making a mistake,&rdquo; agreed Minkie.
&ldquo;If you take my advice you will come with me
this afternoon and find out what it is Jack
wants to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;How can I? Where can I see him? We
can&rsquo;t go to the Manor House.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I have arranged to meet Jack at half-past
two near the Four Lanes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You have arranged!&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes. While you were squinting up to
find out if your hat was at the right tilt I was
watching Jack drawing a cross and 2.30 on
the gravel with his stick. I nodded, so that
is all right. Are you coming?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Dolly was flurried. &ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand things,
Minkie. Dad is desperately anxious that we
should not offend Mr. Schwartz, who can be
either a very good friend or a dangerous enemy.
Oh, sis! What a happy world it would be if
we had all the money we want!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps. Schwartz is rich, and he looked
happy last night, didn&rsquo;t he? Jack&rsquo;s uncle is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>rolling in coin, and to-day he is nursing a foot
the size of an elephant&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I am not thinking of myself, Minkie.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I know that. You are trying to help Dad,
and he is fretting because he has to pay a lot
of money on the 10th of January.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Dolly opened her eyes widely.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Who told <i>you</i>?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Sh-s-s-sh. There&rsquo;s Mam calling. She
wants us to look in at nurse&rsquo;s cottage. What
about Jack&mdash;quick!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; whispered Dolly.</p>

<p class="indent">People who play poker are a bit doubtful
when they say that. If you add the recognized
fact that the woman who hesitates is
lost you will understand at once that when
Minkie and I climbed over the orchard fence
at 2.15, Miss Dorothy came running after us.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Mam has gone upstairs, and Mr. Schwartz
and father are in the library, so I will join you
in your stroll,&rdquo; she said, trying to keep up a
pretence.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Step out, then,&rdquo; said Minkie. &ldquo;Jack will
be waiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">He was. He saw us coming long before we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>reached the cross roads, and his first words
meant war.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Who is this fellow Schwartz?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;A friend of&mdash;father&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Dorothy.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, he is a rogue,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I
wanted to warn Mr. Grosvenor about him
this morning, but he wouldn&rsquo;t listen to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, was that it?&rdquo; and Dorothy&rsquo;s nose
went up in the air.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Partly. Not all. I say, Minkie, if you
take Dan into the warren you will find a heap
of rabbits. The keepers are a mile away. I
told them you were coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Then Dan can go by himself. I am far
more interested in Schwartz than Dot is. Do
you know anything about ju-jus?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;By Jove, Minkie, you do come to the point.
Why, that blessed nigger prince is at the
Manor now, plotting all sorts of mischief with
my uncle.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;How did he get there? I suppose you met
him last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes. I was passing along the road when
I heard Jim turn him out of the gate, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>order him not to show his black mug inside
the grounds again. I wondered what on
earth a darky was doing at Dale End.
Thinking he was a Hindu, one of the natives
who come to England to read up law, I spoke
to him, but as soon as we reached a lamp I
saw he was a negro. He was in awful trouble,
and appeared to have been badly handled.
As soon as he discovered that I was a friend
of yours&mdash;which I mean to remain, no matter
how your father and my uncle disagree&mdash;he
became very excited and appealed to me for
assistance. The villagers spotted him and
began to gather, so I took him to the Manor,
unfortunately.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Why unfortunately?&rdquo; demanded Minkie.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Because some of the servants told my
uncle he was there, and the old boy made me
bring him upstairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I nearly lost my temper with both of them.
It seems that Schwartz, who was a low-down
trader on the Niger, stole some sort of ju-ju,
or small fetish, belonging to the Kwantu bushmen,
the most powerful tribe in the hinterland.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>That was three years ago. Since then
he has become enormously wealthy, and the
niggers say it is because he holds this ju-ju,
which is the luckiest thing in Africa. They,
at least, have had all sorts of plagues since
they lost it, tsetse fly, smallpox, bad rubber
years, and I don&rsquo;t know what besides. At
any rate they are on the verge of rebellion.
Their ju-ju men, or wizards, are preaching
wholesale murder of the whites. Some German
traders have supplied them with Mannlicher
rifles and ammunition, and there is real
danger of a terrific mutiny. Now, I am a
British officer, and I have some experience of
superstitious natives, if not of negroes, so I
can quite realize what may happen out there
if the cause of disaffection is not removed.
You can hardly grasp the serious nature of
the business, Minkie, but Dorothy, being
older&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Can appreciate it much better, of course,&rdquo;
said Minkie. &ldquo;Yet I am beginning to see
things. Did Prince John say what would
happen if the ju-ju were restored?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;That is a very sensible question for a kid,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>observed Jack, approvingly. &ldquo;He vows that
the whole affair will end the instant the
Kwantu ju-ju men receive back their fetish.
He, and a few leading bushmen, some of
whom have been educated in England, remember,
have restrained the mutiny by a
solemn undertaking to bring the god home
before the spring rains begin. They have
offered Schwartz all the money they can scrape
together if he will only give it up, but he
laughs at them and defies them.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t seem to laugh last night,&rdquo; put
in Minkie.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Do you believe he has really lost it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh yes. I am quite sure of that?&rdquo; and
she felt in her pocket absent-mindedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, I am at my wits&rsquo; end to decide how
to act. Prince John is equally certain that
Schwartz has recovered it. When Dan
brought him down, a small bag in which he
had placed the ju-ju was knocked out of his
hand, and it must, therefore, be in Holly
Lodge somewhere. The negro is a determined
man, and there is a look in his eyes
which I have seen in a Pathan&rsquo;s when&mdash;Well,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>no matter. If your father will not meet me
he will at least read a letter. Now, Minkie,
it will soon be too dark to find anything among
the bushes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Rats!&rdquo; cried Minkie, so sharply that I
jumped, thinking she meant it. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got
six months&rsquo; furlough, so you&rsquo;ll meet Dot often
enough. Please go on. What does Prince
John intend to do next?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;He may endeavor to burgle your house.
He will kill Schwartz if need be. He will certainly
kill Dan.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Oh, <i>in</i>deed! I pricked up my ears at this.
What between the nigger and the mongoose
I&rsquo;m in for a lively time. Nobody is going
to be happy until I am cold meat.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;But they will put him in gaol if he tries
burglary?&rdquo; said Minkie, who was unmoved
by the prospect of my early death.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;He says that Schwartz simply dare not
face him in a court of law.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It is our house, you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Stanhope sighed perplexedly. He
was a man, discussing hard things with two
girls. Minkie gave me a look as much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>as to say &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t miss a word of this,&rdquo; and
went on:</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Of course, one can&rsquo;t credit the absurd
idea that a piece of wood, or brass, or whatever
it is, can bring good luck to anyone who
possesses it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Our ebony acquaintance holds so strongly
to the absurdity that he will stop short of
nothing in the effort to secure it. And my
old fool of an&mdash;I beg your pardon, I mean
my respected uncle, is actually plotting with
him as to ways and means. He is in favor
of informing the Government, but the Kwantu
gentleman says the Colonial office will scoff
at the notion. He is right there. The officials
in Whitehall always do scoff until a certain
number of white men and women are
murdered, and an army corps has to be sent
to exact vengeance.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It seems to me that the killing will begin
here, probably with a white dog&mdash;r-r-rip!&rdquo;
observed Minkie, stooping to dig me in the
ribs.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Mongoose!&rdquo; I yelled, but she didn&rsquo;t appear
to take any notice.</p>

<p class="gap">&#160;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i074.jpg" width="400" height="602" alt="Minkie took the ivory doll from her pocket and

<div class="gap">&nbsp;</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t write to dad if I were you,&rdquo;
she continued. &ldquo;He would simply take sides
with Schwartz. But you can write to me,
if you like, only you must not wink, nor send
postcards.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Dorothy will tell you. Come on, Dan,
let&rsquo;s have a look at the warren.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">When we were quite by ourselves Minkie
took the ivory doll from her pocket and surveyed
it seriously.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Ju-ju,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I hope you can really
accomplish these wonders, because I&rsquo;m going
to do things, and there will be a fearful row
if I don&rsquo;t succeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">I nearly killed twice in ten minutes, but a
warren is the deuce and all if some of the holes
are not stopped and you have no ferret.
When we rejoined the others any dog could
see that Dorothy had been crying. Yet she
didn&rsquo;t exactly look miserable, like Jim&rsquo;s wife
looked when her first baby died. Women are
queer. Sometimes you can&rsquo;t tell whether they
are glad or sorry, because they weep just the
same.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>
<p class="indent">The girls were dressing for dinner when a
man in livery came with a wooden box and a
note for &ldquo;Miss Millicent Grosvenor.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Oh, wow and wag everlasting&mdash;it&rsquo;s the
mongoose!</p>

<h2 class="no-break" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">THE WHITE MAN&rsquo;S WAY</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>Told by Tibbie, the Cat</i></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>S this record of events at Dale End now
enters on a phase demanding intelligence
of a somewhat high order for its recital, I
take up the tale at a point where Dan becomes
incoherent. I admit I was greatly interested
myself when Minkie, without waiting for
Evangeline to do up her blouse, glissaded
down the stair rail and rushed the cage into
the morning-room. I had heard of mongooses
from Tommy Willoughby, who lives
in our road, as he had come across them when
the Colonel commanded the Galway Blazers
at Alexandria. He says they eat crocodiles&rsquo;
eggs, and are therefore held in high regard by
the Egyptians, and the Egyptians, judged by
their treatment of cats, are evidently a sensible
<span class="pagenum padpage" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>race. Yet there are no crocodiles&rsquo; eggs at
Dale End, fresh ones, that is, so I pity this
poor stranger if Jim or Mole catches him
dining in the hen-house. I tried a young
Dorking myself once, and Jim behaved very
unfeelingly with a whip.</p>

<p class="indent">Dan, of course, tore after Minkie with his
mouth open, and his stump of a tail pointing
north. I crept in noiselessly, and watched
proceedings from beneath a wide and deep
leather chair. I could see a thing like a big
red rat behind some wooden bars which ran
down one side of a soap box. The animal
had a sharp muzzle, small paws with fairly
useful claws, and a tail that was almost the
size of the remainder of its body.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;A mongoose can fight,&rdquo; I reasoned, &ldquo;and
its huge tail shows that it can turn quickly.&rdquo;
Dan, naturally, took no stock of these essentials.
He was nearly beside himself with
excitement, and Minkie had to grab him with
one hand while she held Captain Stanhope&rsquo;s
letter in the other.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Do be quiet, Dan!&rdquo; she cried, shaking
him. &ldquo;Tibbie, where are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; I meow&rsquo;d.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Then listen, the pair of you. Jack writes:
&lsquo;Dear Minkie&mdash;I send the mongoose. He
is very tame, quite a lovable little chap. You
can let him run about the house at once if all
the doors are closed. After a day or two he
can go out into the garden safely, as he will
always come back to his box if you leave it
open. He is accustomed to my dogs, and
there are terriers among them, so make Dan
understand that the mongoose wants to play
with him when he stands up as if he were going
to box with his fore-paws. You may have
more trouble with Tib, but she will soon learn
to treat him as one of the family. For that
matter, Rikki (that is his name) can keep
either of them in order if he is not taken by
surprise by reason of his friendliness with all
my live stock. He will eat most things they
eat. When the frost goes, and he can hunt
in the garden, he will keep himself. Yours,
Jack.&rsquo; So there! Just try and behave decently
when I introduce Rikki.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Dan&rsquo;s growls died away in a sort of groan.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have that buck nigger stroking me and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>saying &lsquo;Good dog&rsquo; next,&rdquo; he muttered bitterly.
And then it was all I could do to keep from
smiling when I saw Minkie open the cage and
take the mongoose out, gripping Dan tightly
lest his feelings should overcome him. Will
you believe it, that queer-looking beast seemed
quite pleased to see Dan! It jumped up and
licked his whiskers, and tickled his ears with
its little hands, while all poor Dan could say
was &ldquo;Gnar-r!&rdquo; and roll his eyes wildly to see
what it was doing, Minkie&rsquo;s fingers being like
bits of steel. At last, grief and curiosity conquered
him. He sniffed it, and Minkie let go.
The parrot, from the dining-room, guessed
what was happening, and shouted &ldquo;Hark to
him, Boxer! Back to him, Bendigo! At him,
boy! At him!&rdquo; But it was no use. May I
never have another night out if Dan and
Rikki were not having a friendly wrestle on
the hearth-rug in half a minute.</p>

<p class="indent">The mongoose had quick eyes. When it
rolled over in the game it saw me. I must say
it had some sense, too; it seemed to know that
I was not given to any dog-foolery, and it
squared itself for battle. Dan, thinking to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>show off, charged full tilt for my chair, so I
determined to take a rise out of him. I began
to purr, walked straight up to him, with my
tail well aloft and the tip twiddling, and began
to rub myself against his ribs.</p>

<p class="indent">You never saw a dog so taken aback. I&rsquo;m
sure he thought I was crazy, and even Minkie
said softly:</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, I never! Is the ju-ju beginning to
work already?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Odd, isn&rsquo;t it? She attributed my little joke
to that chunk of ivory in her pocket. Anyhow,
the mongoose took no liberties with me.
When all is said and done, Dan and I are in
one camp, and every sort of rat in the other&mdash;but
I am surprised at Dan.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, parcels turn up so continuously at
Christmas time that no one else was aware
of Rikki&rsquo;s arrival until he sat up and begged
from Mr. Schwartz while our visitor was
drinking his soup. The parrot was watching,
and made a horrid noise at the right moment,
just as Schwartz looked down and saw a pair
of fierce red eyes glaring at him. The mongoose
put on his best grin, which made matters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>worse. Schwartz nearly overturned the dinner-table.
I would never have credited six
feet of man with being in such a funk. Everybody
was glad he expressed his emotions in
German&mdash;he himself more than the others
when he calmed down. Minkie nearly came
in for a scolding, but the Guv&rsquo;nor, who is a
real sport, was soon taken by Rikki&rsquo;s antics,
and rather chaffed Schwartz about his alarm.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;That is all very well Grosvenor,&rdquo; said
Schwartz, &ldquo;but you have not lived where
poisonous spiders, centipedes, scorpions, and
all sorts of snakes come prowling into the
house. I have jumped for my life far too
often to be ashamed of a momentary forgetfulness
that I was in England. Moreover, I
was not aware that Millicent was forming a
menagerie.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I hope to have a monkey soon,&rdquo; observed
Minkie.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take jolly good care you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said
her father. &ldquo;Monkeys are most mischievous
brutes, and they disagree with every other
animal near them. By the way, has Dan
seen your new pet?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes. They had quite a romp in the morning-room.
You see I had to read Jack&rsquo;s letter
to both Tibbie and Dan before I introduced
Rikki.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t allude to Captain
Stanhope as &lsquo;Jack.&rsquo; It argues a familiarity
which does not exist.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;If you are speaking of the young gentleman
who hailed you after church to-day, I
should say you were justified in that remark,&rdquo;
put in Schwartz.</p>

<p class="indent">That showed the man&rsquo;s bad taste; but it
told me something more. Since the morning,
his manner towards the Guv&rsquo;nor had
altered. People say I am cruel when I play
with a mouse, forgetting that I must practice
every tricky twist and sidelong spring or I
shall not be able to kill mice at all. However
that may be, I can recognize the trait when I
see it in others, and Schwartz looked and
talked like a man who has another man under
his thumb. Although her father may speak
sharply to Minkie at times, he very strongly
resents such a liberty being taken by an outsider.
Perhaps he thought Schwartz regarded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>the allusion to a monkey as a personal matter.
At any rate, when the parrot told Evangeline
to go and boil her head there was a laugh, and
the incident passed.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, I knew Minkie far too well to
believe that she meant to let Schwartz say
what he liked, but I did not expect her to drop
such a bombshell on the table as she produced
after the pudding appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Talking of monkeys, Mr. Schwartz,&rdquo; she
said when there was a pause in the conversation,
&ldquo;are there many in West Africa?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Swarms,&rdquo; he replied, rather snappy, because
he noticed that Minkie gave his name
the German sound, which is funnier than our
English way of saying it.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Do they worship them?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No, they eat them.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Then why should they make one of their
most powerful ju-jus like a monkey?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">I imagine that for a moment Schwartz really
forgot where he was. His eyes bulged forward,
his face grew red, and big veins stood
out on his forehead.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;What&mdash;do you&mdash;know about it?&rdquo; he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>gasped, glaring at her as though he wanted to
run round the table and wring her neck.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she answered meekly. &ldquo;That
is why I am asking you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;But you have some motive. Such a question
is impossible coming from a child. Who
told you anything of a ju-ju resembling a
monkey?&rdquo; Schwartz was almost shouting
now, and the Old Man gave Mam an imploring
glance. Mam tried to press Minkie&rsquo;s toes
under the table, but Minkie just tucked her
legs beneath her chair out of harm&rsquo;s way, and
not a soul could catch her eye, because she
and Schwartz were looking straight at each
other.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;After the affair last night I read about
ju-jus and fetishism in the Encyclopdia,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;That was very interesting, but I
really had in my mind what Jack&mdash;I mean
Captain Stanhope&mdash;told me to-day. Prince
John assures him that if the ju-ju you took
from his people is not sent back before the
spring rains there will be a rebellion in that
country. So I felt certain it must be a monkey-headed
one, made of ivory, with a little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>beaded skirt, as that is the most powerful
ju-ju known among the Kwantus.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">I wonder Schwartz did not leap at her there
and then. His eyes positively glittered. He
exercised all his powers to regain his self-control,
but his hands shook, and there was a
curious tremor in his voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;This information is, indeed, valuable to
me,&rdquo; he said, dropping his tone to the ordinary
level again. &ldquo;No, I beg of you, Grosvenor,
let Millicent continue. Do I gather that
Captain Stanhope is in league with the negro
thief who made his way to my room last
night?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Did I say that?&rdquo; inquired Minkie, smiling
at Schwartz in a way that those who knew
her dreaded.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You implied it. Evidently your military
friend enjoys Prince John&rsquo;s confidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, if you put it that way you are right.
Prince John is staying at the Manor House
and Captain Stanhope is using his influence
to keep him quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;He told you that.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And I believe him.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;Did he actually describe the ju-ju to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Then how are you able to hit off its
appearance so exactly?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m a good guesser. Isn&rsquo;t that so,
father dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">The Guv&rsquo;nor didn&rsquo;t seem to realize that
Minkie had deliberately pulled him into the
conversation. He was dreadfully upset, and
he tried to cover his confusion by tackling her
on the question of disobedience.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I told you to have nothing further to do
with the Manor House people,&rdquo; he said, and
his voice was very harsh and stern, &ldquo;yet it is
evident you met and talked with young Stanhope
to-day without my cognizance.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes. I met him near the Four Lanes.
You said, father dear, that we were not to exchange
postcards and winks, and that was
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You knew quite well that I meant you to
cut the acquaintance entirely. Millicent, what
has come to you that you should disregard my
wishes in this way?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I am very sorry, dad. I did not think I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>was doing wrong. I promise now that I shall
not speak to Captain Stanhope again until
you give me permission. If I had really meant
to disobey you I would hardly have told you
so openly at table. My idea was that you
would like to know all about this ju-ju which
Mr. Schwartz has lost, and the queer effect it
may have in causing a West African war.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Poor Mam was nearly crying, and Dorothy&rsquo;s
face was a study; she was terrified lest Minkie
should blurt out the fact that she, too, was at
the Four Lanes. As it happened, Minkie
could not have mentioned a worse locality.
It was the Four Lanes warren which first led
to the quarrel between old Mr. Stanhope and
the Guv&rsquo;nor. There was a lawsuit about
the shooting rights, which ought to have gone
with our estate, but Mr. Stanhope&rsquo;s lawyers
made out a flaw in a copyhold, whatever that
may mean, and we lost. I wonder why men
invented law. If they followed our example,
and fought in the good old way, our Old Man
would now own that warren.</p>

<p class="indent">There might have been more unpleasant
things said had not Polly yelled suddenly:</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;Fire! Murder! Per-lice! &rsquo;E dunno where
&rsquo;e are!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">The mongoose had just discovered that it
was the parrot who was growling nasty remarks
at Evangeline because she took the
nuts from the sideboard without giving him
any. Naturally, being a newcomer, Rikki
was surprised, so he had jumped on to the
window-sill to have a look at this queer bird.
Minkie was told to put the mongoose in his
box, as Evangeline declared she wouldn&rsquo;t
touch such an awful objec&rsquo;, not for a million
pounds.</p>

<p class="indent">While Minkie was out of the room the Guv&rsquo;nor
tried to recover his good humor.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You must not pay heed to my little girl&rsquo;s
way of expressing herself, Schwartz,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;We have rather encouraged her to
be outspoken, and she has always been remarkably
intelligent. Try that port. You
will find it good, a &rsquo;74, the last bottle, worse
luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to Holly Lodge and its owner, his
wife and his charming daughters. May we
all be sitting here this time next year!&rdquo; cried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>Schwartz, lifting his glass and glancing at
Dolly.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a pleasant enough toast in its way,
but again I had that feeling under the fur that
the words meant a lot more than they expressed.
Dan naturally said he saw nothing
particular in them, but you will find I was
right. I noticed, too, that Schwartz drank
two glasses of the wine in quick succession,
though he had declined a liqueur the previous
evening. I mentioned this to Dan, but he
only growled:</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You see a sparrow behind every bush.
Schwartz is a rotter, but he is behaving himself.
Why, I have known Jim shift a quart
of beer after he had said he wasn&rsquo;t thirsty,
just because Mam told him to get some lemonade.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Have <i>you</i> ever picked a bone after turning
up your nose at a dog biscuit?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes, but there might have been cat in the
biscuit.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">I turned my back on him. He thinks that
sort of low-down humor is clever, and he
hurries away to tell Bob how he scored off
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>me. Of course, he made tracks to the stable
the moment dinner was ended, with the result
that he missed quite a thrilling episode.</p>

<p class="indent">Mam and Dorothy went to the drawing-room,
but Schwartz, who was listening intently,
heard Minkie go into the morning-room,
whither I had followed her to study the
mongoose at leisure. After a minute or two,
he made the excuse that he wanted to show
the Guv&rsquo;nor a letter which he had left upstairs,
and he came out, though I heard
Poll warbling &ldquo;Kiss me and call me your
darling.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">He closed the door, walked across the hall
to the foot of the stairs, and tip-toe&rsquo;d back to
the morning-room. Minkie looked at me,
and I looked at Minkie.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Now for it!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p class="indent">Schwartz entered. He had the glint in his
eyes which I feel when I have a young thrush
within range of a spring. He never turned
his head, but kept glaring at Minkie while
he fumbled with the lock till the door was
shut. Then he crept, rather than walked,
towards her.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;Now, you young devil!&rdquo; he hissed, &ldquo;give
it to me, or I&rsquo;ll strangle you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">That was the right opening; I began to feel
nervous, and when I say &ldquo;nervous&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t
mean &ldquo;frightened,&rdquo; like Evangeline is when
the villain says something of the sort in the
story she reads each week in the <i>Society Girl&rsquo;s
Companion</i>; in fact, if she begins to wash up
after finishing the instalment she is sure to
smash something. No; that is the mistake
Dan always makes. Had he been in the room
during the next few minutes he would have
alarmed the house by his stupid barking, because
any one could see that Schwartz meant
mischief. Certainly Dan would have bitten
him first, whereas I hid under the leather
chair. <i>Chacun  son gout</i>, as mademoiselle
used to say when she saw Minkie kissing
Bob&rsquo;s nose&mdash;my motto is &ldquo;Defence, not defiance.&rdquo;
But the species of nervousness I
experienced was shared by Minkie. It was
a kind of spiritual exaltation, a bracing of the
muscles, a tuning of the heart-strings which
carries one through a desperate crisis.</p>

<p class="indent">For Schwartz was primed with wine, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>maddened by the knowledge that he had been
tricked by a girl, a girl who was able to survey
his mean soul and appraise its miserable
insufficiency. He thought to frighten her by
letting the beast in him peep forth at her.
Even if she screamed for protection, he counted
on either securing the ju-ju or learning its
whereabouts before her father could come to
her rescue. Then he would explain that he
was joking, while Minkie would receive scant
sympathy when it became known that she had
kept mum as to her possession of an article
which he prized so greatly. Of course, he was
sure she had the ju-ju, and Minkie did not
commit the error of pretending she did not
understand him.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Even if you were able to strangle me I
could not give you what I have not got,&rdquo; said
she, very quietly, standing straight, with her
hands behind her back. I noticed that the
fingers of her right hand were lightly resting
in those of her left, with thumbs crossed, and
that showed she was not going to struggle. I
was somewhat surprised, because with those
wiry hands of hers I have seen her bend a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>stout poker across her knee, and she could
vault astride Bob&rsquo;s back from the ground by
taking a twist of his mane in them. She has
done that several times since she had an argument
with Dolly one day last November, when
she proved that Sir Walter Scott made young
Lochinvar perform a remarkable gymnastic
feat in the lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So light to the saddle before her he sprung!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">It was evident that young Lochinvar&rsquo;s right
leg must have gone clean over the fair lady&rsquo;s
picture hat, so <i>I</i> think that the poet meant
&ldquo;clung&rdquo;; but, anyhow, what I want to convey
now is that Minkie could have landed on
Schwartz&rsquo;s shoulders and tapped the bald
spot on his head with one of the fire-irons at
one and the same instant if she had meant
to fight.</p>

<p class="indent">Her attitude seemed to me to be rather
foolhardy. No matter what you may say
about the triumph of mind over matter I
believe in having the brute force side of the
thesis ready for action if necessary. Schwartz,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
however, thought she was afraid, which proves
conclusively that he was a man of limited
ideas, even if he were rich as Cr&oelig;sus. He did
not believe her, though a gentleman should
always pretend to believe a lady, even though
he knows she is telling a fib. His mouth
opened and he held his tongue between his
teeth. He came nearer, carrying his hands
up like a hawk&rsquo;s talons. This was partly
pantomime and partly real. The pantomime
was essential in Dale End; had Minkie been
in the Kwantu bush she might have seen more
of the reality; but then, under the latter conditions,
she would have shown Schwartz a
<i>savate</i> kick which I taught her, and he must
have bitten off the end of his tongue in learning
it. One acquires a lot of capital dodges,
I assure you, when defending the top of a wall
on a dark night.</p>

<p class="gap">&#160;</p>

<div class="figcenter bbox" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i097.jpg" width="400" height="645" alt="But she stood there quite motionless" title="" id="i097" />
</div>

<div class="gap">&#160;</div>

<p class="indent">But she stood there, quite motionless, a
slight, elegant figure in white Surah silk, with
black stockings and nice shiny shoes, on
which were a pair of her Grandmother Faulkner&rsquo;s
paste buckles, which Mam had just
given her as a Christmas present. Her flaxen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>hair was tied with a ribbon of almost the same
tint, and she wore a strip of the ribbon as a
waist-belt. I wish somebody could have
drawn her as she faced Schwartz, who was
well dressed, of course, but whose leering face
was like the satyr&rsquo;s in our garden. And he
had called her a devil! Well, tastes differ, as
I have remarked previously. Being only a
cat, I don&rsquo;t know much about these things,
but my money goes on Schwartz if there is a
prize competition for a model of old Hoof and
Horns.</p>

<p class="indent">I have taken my time over this part of the
story to enable you to realise the suspense, the
wolfish aspect, the stealthy threatening of
Schwartz&rsquo;s advance towards Minkie. Obviously,
the mere clock ticking was short
enough.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; he breathed again, so close that
his wine-laden breath was offensive to her.
Then he grasped her arms, and began to pass
his coarse hands down her body. I am telling
you the simple truth. He actually searched
her clothes, pressing them to her limbs to
make sure that his precious ju-ju was not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>secreted somewhere about her. I held my
breath, and I really had it in my mind to jump
up at his staring eyes, when I chanced to
catch Minkie&rsquo;s contemptuous smile. Then I
knew that she had fooled Schwartz again,
had, in fact, expected him to adopt some such
futile dodge, and had put the fetish in a secure
hiding-place.</p>

<p class="indent">Disappointment nearly drove the man off
his balance. He was so enraged that he
shook her violently.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You <i>must</i> give it up,&rdquo; he said hoarsely.
&ldquo;I am determined to have it, now, this instant.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Minkie remained quite passive.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;If I call my father he will horsewhip you,&rdquo;
she said coolly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Give me that ju-ju,&rdquo; he almost whimpered,
such was his fury.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You have satisfied yourself that I have not
got it,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Take your hands off
me, or it will be bad for you. If you ever
dare to touch me again, you will never see it.
If you try to behave as decently as you know
how, I may, perhaps, discuss terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>
<p class="indent">It was ludicrous to watch his change of
attitude. From a bold lion he became a
cringing jackal. He almost wept with relief
at the mention of the word &ldquo;terms.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Anything you like,&rdquo; he cried eagerly.
&ldquo;What do you want&mdash;money, diamonds,
anything?&mdash;but I must have it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">The man was crazy, talking that way to a
girl just turned fourteen. Had she been ten
years older she might have listened; twenty,
and she might have closed the deal straight
off. But Minkie was young enough to be
chivalrous, and she meant to make Schwartz
eat mud.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You cannot obtain it now,&rdquo; she said,
speaking as calmly as she does to Mole when
she wants the tennis net fixed. &ldquo;You had
better cool down rapidly, because you will not
see your ju-ju until New Year&rsquo;s Day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he yelled, forgetting himself and
trying to grab her again. This time Minkie
adopted tactics which I fully approved of.
She sprang back and sideways, placing my
chair between Schwartz and herself. Then
she seized a heavy glass encrire.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;One inch nearer and you receive this in
the face,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I never miss,&rdquo;
she added, seeing that Schwartz halted.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, I had to move quickly, too; as I
passed Rikki&rsquo;s box I saw him gazing out with
such a puzzled expression. It did not occur
to me previously that he understands Hindustani
better than English, which is a pity, as
we never before have had any real excitement
like this at Holly Lodge. It was as good as a
play to see Schwartz glowering at Minkie, and
estimating the effect of a two-pound inkpot
if applied to his nose with a velocity of X
miles per second. Talk about motor traps
and policemen&rsquo;s stop watches&mdash;he made a
lightning calculation I can assure you, and
it was dead against any forward movement.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Suppose we abandon hostilities and discuss
matters reasonably,&rdquo; he said, with another violent
effort at self-control. &ldquo;To begin with, I
can compel you to hand over my property.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It is not your property. You stole it. It
belongs to the Kwantu tribe. If I were to
act with strict honesty, I should hand it to
Prince John.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>
<p class="indent">Schwartz fell into the net like the silliest
bunny that ever ran for a hedge. He assumed
instantly that Minkie could be bribed.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You are too young to judge of such matters,&rdquo;
he sneered. &ldquo;Moreover, I have only
to appeal to your father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You will find him in the dining-room.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Poor Schwartz! I was beginning to pity
him. Even the mongoose saw the joke, and
grinned, because we hunting animals know all
about bluff&mdash;we meet with lots of it down
our way. He determined that it was advisable
to deal with Minkie herself, which was precisely
what she wanted. You see, these rich
men think money will buy anything.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Why New Year&rsquo;s Day?&rdquo; he asked anxiously,
while I noticed that his collar was limp
with perspiration. &ldquo;Why not to-night? I
have plenty of money in notes. And if more
is needed, I would never dream of stopping
a cheque once it is written.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I cannot give you the ju-ju before this day
week,&rdquo; said Minkie. &ldquo;I have my reasons,
and I decline to state them. Nor can I tell
you my terms until two or three days have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>passed. But I want 50 now for expenses.
If you have not that sum with you, I can wait
until to-morrow or the day after.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Schwartz gazed at her with amazement. He
was burning to ask her a dozen questions, but
Dan came scratching and sniffing at the door,
so they might be interrupted any moment. The
man dared not forego the opportunity of clinching
the bargain, yet his greed kept him back.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Fifty pounds!&mdash;expenses!&ldquo; he protested.
&rdquo;Why, how much do you expect me to pay
for the thing itself?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; said Minkie. &ldquo;I can easily
get the money elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">He knew she meant the Manor House, and
that frightened him. Dan kept scratching
away, and saying: &ldquo;Let me in! What&rsquo;s
on? Bones and cleavers, open the door!&rdquo;
Schwartz produced a pocketbook, and pulled
out a note.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;will that suffice?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">It was fifty pounds all right, but Minkie
did not trouble to examine it.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can change it at the
bank if necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;And you promise&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You shall have your ju-ju on New Year&rsquo;s
Day.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;But I insist on learning something further
as to its safety. How can you be sure Prince
John&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Just then Mam heard Dan damaging our
best paint; she crossed the hall and flung the
door wide.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;This wretched dog&mdash;&rdquo; she began, but
stopped short on seeing Schwartz and Minkie.
Schwartz swallowed something, and grinned
like a death&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;This mongoose is an extraordinary creature,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I have taken quite a fancy
to him....&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">He rejoined the Guv&rsquo;nor, as he had the
letter in his pocketbook all the time. Dolly
was playing and singing &ldquo;Du, du liegst mir
im Herzen,&rdquo; so Mam thought she had a good
chance of explaining matters to Minkie.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I hope you will be nice to Mr. Schwartz if
he takes an interest in your pets,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You annoyed your father considerably during
dinner by your unwarrantable hostility to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>our guest. I am more than surprised at
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Please forgive me, mother dear. And
you might tell Dad that I have cleared away
all misunderstandings between Mr. Schwartz
and myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Misunderstandings, child! How can you
possibly use such a word where a gentleman
is concerned of whom you have seen so little?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;There are some people whom one gets to
know very quickly. Do you remember the
burglar whom our policeman caught as he
was climbing the rectory wall? Those two
had never seen each other before, yet we met
them coming down the road arm-in-arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Mam laughed. &ldquo;You are always ready
enough to turn a difficult conversation when
it suits your purpose. Why don&rsquo;t you show
equal tact in your remarks to Mr. Schwartz?
I would not ask this, Millicent, if I had not a
special reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Tell me, mummy dear. Is Mr. Schwartz
going to lend Dad some money?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You certainly are the most amazing child!&rdquo;
cried Mam. &ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;No one. I just imagined it; and I will
tell you why. One day last week I saw that
Dad was awfully cut up about something he
read in the paper. It was about the Kwantu
Mines, Limited. I know, because I picked
up the paper in order to see what was worrying
Dad.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;But you shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mam, though
her lips quivered a little. Now, there is not
a person alive who can be more affectionate
than Minkie with those whom she loves.
I like being petted myself, so I know.
She put her arms round her mother and
whispered:</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I hope Dad and you won&rsquo;t fret. I am
sure everything will come right in the end.
Don&rsquo;t you think it is a sign of something out
of the common going to happen when this
black prince comes to our house, a man from
the very place which is causing Dad so much
trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">While Mam searched for her handkerchief
Dan muttered to me:</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;A pretty game you&rsquo;ve been having here
while I was looking after affairs outside.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>What has Schwartz been up to? And what
good is a cat, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">That put my back up.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Let me tell you that if you had been in this
room during the past five minutes you would
have made a beastly fool of yourself and
spoiled the finest bit of sport we&rsquo;ve ever had,&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p class="indent">He was so tickled with conceit that he
sneezed.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Go away and play, pussy,&rdquo; he sniggered.
&ldquo;You me-ow while I act. Why, I&rsquo;ve been
chasing niggers all over the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">That startled me. Bad as he is, Dan never
lies.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Chasing niggers!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Is there more
of &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I counted no less than five,&rdquo; he growled,
strutting about in great style, and rather
alarming the mongoose. I assure you his
news so upset me that I paid no attention to
what Minkie and Mam were saying until I
heard Minkie mention Jack&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I wish you could persuade Dad to see
Captain Stanhope,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The merest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>little note would bring him here to-morrow,
and there can be no doubt he would give Dad
some very useful information.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Ah, my dear, if I had my way things would
be different,&rdquo; sighed Mam; then, feeling that
discussion would do no good, she bustled out,
bidding Minkie turn the gas low and come
to the drawing-room.</p>

<p class="indent">Dan was bursting to get Minkie outside
and let her know about the suspicious characters
who were prowling round our house, but
she wouldn&rsquo;t listen to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, be quiet,&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;I want
to do a sum.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">First, she took the crisp note out of her
pocket and looked to see if it was really fifty
pounds.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Let me reckon up,&rdquo; she said then. &ldquo;I
began yesterday with a crooked sixpence. I
gave the porter a shilling out of Schwartz&rsquo;s
fiver for telling me Jack arrived by the 4.20.
So now I have fifty-four pounds, nineteen
shillings and sixpence. Good old ju-ju!
Keep it going! I am pretty strong in arithmetic,
but if you maintain that rate of increase
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>until New Year&rsquo;s Day, I shall lose count.
Anyhow, they&rsquo;ll want a bigger bank at Dale
End. Now, Dan, I&rsquo;m ready. What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">But, before she crossed the hall, she rescued
the ju-ju from its hiding-place at the back of
the grandfathers clock.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE BLACK MAN&rsquo;S WAY</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>Told by Polly, the Parrot</i></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">Y</span>OU will observe that I was left in the
dining-room with the Guv&rsquo;nor. Those
insignificant quadrupeds, Dan and Tib,
thought that I was out of the fun. They
always do think that, until they come smirking
to me for news; then they go off and
backbite me behind my tail feathers. That
impudent whelp, Dan, sidled up this morning
to ask me what a mongoose was. When I was
weak enough, at the mention of grapes, to
tell him it was an ichneumon, he had the
cheek to call me some outlandish name that
no decent bird would dream of using. I&rsquo;ll
make it hot for him, see if I don&rsquo;t. And that
yellow-eyed Tibbie, for all her dainty ways
and quiet talk, is not much better. Sometimes,
when I have a bath, I flick a few drops
<span class="pagenum padpage" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>of water over her, and she looks at me as much
as to say: &ldquo;Oh, if only I could lay a paw on
you!&rdquo; Yet, mark my word, she&rsquo;ll be trotting
in here for a chat as soon as I say a word
about the discussion between Schwartz and
the Old Man.</p>

<p class="indent">I have been keeping an eye on the Guv&rsquo;nor
recently. Between you and me, it was he
who taught me all the funny bits I know.
There is nothing he enjoys more than to hear
Mam exclaim: &ldquo;Dear me! How in the world
does the bird learn those vulgar songs?&rdquo;
It&rsquo;s as easy as sitting on a rail. Some Italian
ragamuffins come to Dale End occasionally
with a Handel piano&mdash;eh, what? not that
sort of handle; well, you know the thing I
mean&mdash;and I pick up the tunes. When the
Guv&rsquo;nor hears me whistling them he sings the
words, and at the next chance I get I amaze
Mam with &ldquo;My Irish Molly O&rdquo; or &ldquo;Why do
they call me the Gibson Girl?&rdquo; The Guv&rsquo;nor
finds out all about these things in London.
Once Minkie asked him how he did it, and
he told her he learnt them from the office-boy.
I wish I knew that boy.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>
<p class="indent">Now, it&rsquo;s a solemn fact that I have not added
a line to my collection during the past month.
I know several new airs, and I have whistled
them regularly, but the Old Man remains
silent. At first I imagined that perhaps the
office-boy had a swollen face, but soon I felt
sure my teacher had lost his spirits. Minkie
noticed it, but I found it out long before her.
You see, we parrots are very wise birds, quick
to observe, and able to examine any new
notion from all points of view; my habit of
looking at Dan upside down riles him far
more than the silly things I shout at him.</p>

<p class="indent">Minkie, I gathered, guessed that her father
was in trouble over some Stock Exchange
business, and the mention of Kwantu by Captain
Stanhope brought back to her mind the
name of the mining company whose affairs,
as discussed in a newspaper, seemed to be the
cause of the worry. But it was I, the &ldquo;giddy
acrobat,&rdquo; as Dan calls me, who hit on the
real mystery, and I made even stolid Bob
wild before I told him all about it next day.</p>

<p class="indent">While Schwartz was interviewing Minkie
in the morning-room, the Guv&rsquo;nor sat and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>stared at the fire. He was smoking, but he
didn&rsquo;t seem to enjoy his cigar, and he had that
queer look in his face which men call despair.
&rsquo;Pon my honor, I would rather be a bird
than a man any day. We feathered folk don&rsquo;t
sigh and abandon hope when things go wrong.
Why, the commonest little sparrow in the
garden would chirp his contempt if anybody
suggested to him that he should lie down and
die just because he couldn&rsquo;t find an insect
under the first leaf he turned over. Die, indeed!
Not he! He works all the harder,
and is very likely to be rewarded by a fine fat
grub under the next bush.</p>

<p class="indent">It was quite evident that the Guv&rsquo;nor had
not realized the length of Schwartz&rsquo;s absence
when that gentleman reappeared. He looked
up, rather miserably, and said:</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I am sorry to have troubled you in the
matter, Schwartz. And I fear you are having
a poor time of it, what between the recital
of my difficulties and the unfortunate incident
which took place last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Last night&rsquo;s affair will adjust itself in a
day or two,&rdquo; answered Schwartz, grimly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>thinking, no doubt, of the 50 note he had
just tossed to Minkie. &ldquo;The really important
item now is this absurd predicament of yours,
Grosvenor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that the suggestion came from
you in the first instance.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I am well aware you asked me to let you
know if there was anything good going,&rdquo; said
Schwartz, rather stiffly. &ldquo;My friends usually
follow my judgment with satisfactory results,
and I was quite certain that this Kwantu mine
was a swindle, but how was I to ascertain
that this special flotation was to be made use
of for a squeeze? And you are not the only
fish struggling in the net.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Then the others have my sympathy. Yet
it was a piece of lunacy on my part to indulge
in a heavy bear speculation in interests of
which I was utterly ignorant. I don&rsquo;t mind
losing a hundred or two in a fair gamble, and
I have usually come out on the right side of
the ledger, but it was the worst sort of madness
to sell a thousand shares in a West African
Company. Good heavens! What right has
a man who is almost a sleeping partner in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>city warehouse to dabble in concerns like
that!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said Schwartz, giving his
friend a quick side look as he took a letter
from his pocket, &ldquo;you sold at something over
par?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the Guv&rsquo;nor, still gazing
at the fire.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And they are now at 6-1/4?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes. Over 5,000 gone already, and the
special settlement due on the 10th of next
month.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Can you buy at that price?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I suppose so. Unhappily, I am a child
in these matters. I honestly believe that my
little Millicent would have avoided this trap
which I blundered into so easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Um-m,&rdquo; said Schwartz.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;But surely your inquiries have not led
you to expect the price to go higher?&rdquo; demanded
the Guv&rsquo;nor, growing almost white
with misery.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; cried the other man
blandly, &ldquo;when you are in the hands of unscrupulous
rascals you never know when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>they will be satisfied. The thing is beautifully
simple. You and others have sold a
bear. You are called on to deliver your
shares, which you cannot do, for the very good
reason that the market is controlled by the
people who bought all the shares offered. You
have fallen among thieves. There is no telling
what price they may force things up to
before they let go.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Then the issue is quite plain,&rdquo; said the
Guv&rsquo;nor, rising with the air of a man who has
no more to say. &ldquo;It will cripple, indeed,
almost ruin me to raise five thousand pounds.
Any material advance on that amount means
bankruptcy, with goodness knows what evil
results to my wife and daughters. If there
is any law in the land it should not be possible
for men to crush others in this barefaced
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;The law cannot help you. But sit down,
Grosvenor. Let us hammer this thing out.
I have tried to ascertain the identity of the
promoters, and I have failed. Here is the
letter my brokers wrote me yesterday. You
see they say that the company is registered in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>Jersey, and the nominal directors are mere
figure-heads. The real manipulators of the
stock do not appear on the surface&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Surely you, who are so well acquainted
with West Africa, can make a tolerably accurate
guess as to the people behind the
scenes?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;If I had the slightest grounds for naming
any one I should not only tell you, Grosvenor,
but I would gladly lend my personal assistance
in arranging matters.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">The Old Man read the typewritten letter
which Schwartz gave him. Of course, I did
not know then what was in it, but it seemed
to substantiate Schwartz&rsquo;s statements.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Amazing thing!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;And
that I should be such a fool! I only wanted
to earn an extra hundred or so, for the sake
of the girls, to give them some little luxuries
which diminishing dividends hardly permit
of, and this is the result&mdash;I find myself on the
very brink of ruin. Ah, well! Let me apologize
again for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Have you any objection, then, to a full
and frank discussion of the matter with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gap">&#160;</p>

</div><div class="gap">&nbsp;</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;Great Scott, no! Why do you put such a
question?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Please sit down, then. The ladies can
spare us from the drawing-room a little longer.
Dorothy is singing, and Millicent is&mdash;er&mdash;engaged
with her new pet, while Mrs. Grosvenor
will not object, I am sure, if we smoke
another cigar. Now, to come to the point.
I have been thinking matters over during the
day, and I have a proposition to make which
may commend itself to you. It is no secret
to you that I admire your elder daughter very
much. Were I your prospective son-in-law,
Grosvenor, I would be prepared to take your
liabilities on to my own shoulders. And let
me say at once that I am not bargaining with
you for Dorothy&rsquo;s hand. You know that I
was anxious to pay her my addresses in Ostend,
and this Kwantu business was not in
existence at that time. You gave a conditional
assent to my suit then. Now I am only asking
you to exercise a little judicious parental
pressure on a charming girl who hardly knows
her own mind. I am sure you will not think
the less of me because I endeavor to gain my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>own ends whilst coming to your assistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">I whistled loudly in my surprise. I couldn&rsquo;t
help it, but it seemed to annoy Schwartz, who
glared at me quite vindictively. The Guv&rsquo;nor,
of course, paid no heed, being accustomed
to my interruptions.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It is awfully good of you,&rdquo; he said slowly,
&ldquo;and I admit the justice of your contention
that your wish to marry Dorothy is nothing
new. But I have always held it a fixed principle,
which my wife shares with me, that
parents should neither force their children to
marry for money nor withhold their consent to
marriages based on love, unless the drawbacks
are out of all reason. As I understand the position,
Dorothy did not exactly refuse you at Ostend,
but simply declared that she had no wish
to leave her home for some years to come?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes. That is so.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Then, if I go to her now, and tell her you
stipulate for her hand as a condition for extricating
me from&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; broke in Schwartz, with a
certain prompt candor which did him credit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>as an actor. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask that. I only want
your permission to approach her myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;But you had that six months ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes, and I am exceedingly grateful to
you. What I seek to-day is your promise to
further my request by varying your attitude
from passive approval to active support.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">He was artful, that Schwartz. The Old
Man wriggled a bit, but he hardly knew what
to say. He was a thoroughbred, you see,
and he hated the idea of bartering one of his
girls for five thousand pounds. Yet Schwartz
was what ladies who come to tea call &ldquo;a good
catch,&rdquo; and it was quite true that he was after
Dorothy months before anybody at Holly
Lodge so much as heard the word &ldquo;Kwantu.&rdquo;
And the Guv&rsquo;nor was a proud man, too. It
was Schwartz himself who had led him to believe
that it would be an easy thing to make
money by selling shares in this mine, yet
Minkie told me afterwards that he seemed to
be quite surprised when her father informed
him that he had taken the &ldquo;tip&rdquo; and sold
heavily. That was in November, when the
mine was floated, and Schwartz had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>absent in Paris until the third week in December.
Now, as the German was a millionaire,
and had landed a friend in a hole by his advice,
it was reasonable enough to expect him
to lend a helping hand, yet there could be no
doubt he meant to take advantage of the
difficulty and compel Dorothy to marry him
to save her father.</p>

<p class="indent">I saw the bearings of the game far more
clearly than the Guv&rsquo;nor. My own opinion
was that Schwartz was a regular scamp, and
my experience of scamps is fairly wide, as I
hail from South America. You would hardly
credit the ups and downs of my life&mdash;no
wonder I can take a man&rsquo;s measure with fair
accuracy. I began my education in an Indian
village, after discovering that a baited
trap is not exactly what it looks like. Then
I went by train to Montevideo, and the things
I learnt there would make you weep if I told
you even the half which the Spanish language
permits. A nigger fireman knifed my owner,
a saloon-keeper, and was one of a crowd which
cleared out the bar before the patrol came.
He brought me to New York, and pawned me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>to an East-side crimp. I was stolen from
there, and hung outside a sixth-floor tenement
until I was sold to a bird-fancier in
Eighth Avenue. He was a Dago, so I need
say no more about him. If Mam understood
the least little bit of Italian she wouldn&rsquo;t keep
me in the house five minutes, but you bet I
take a rise out of those organ-grinders when
they come touting for coppers. Giovanni
traded me for five dollars to a patriotic American
named O&rsquo;Reilly, and he gave me a university
course which ended suddenly by his
going to Sing-Sing, while I was seized, with
the remainder of the furniture, by another
American citizen named Rosenbaum. During
the annual fire at his place I was rescued by a
ship&rsquo;s steward, who liked the way I talked.
On the way to England he died from want of
proper liquid nourishment, and the crew would
have kept me in the forecastle if some old girl
had not complained to the captain of the
dreadful language used by one of the men
whenever she leaned over the forward rail.
How was I to know she could speak the
tongues of the Sunny South?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>
<p class="indent">Believe me, even after I arrived at Liverpool,
my adventures would fill a book, but I
have said enough to show that I was ready to
appreciate a good home when the Guv&rsquo;nor
found me in Leadenhall Market, and took
me to Dale End as a present to Minkie.
More than that, you never really appreciate
a good home until you have had a few bad
ones, and it is in the latter that you obtain any
genuine schooling in the darker side of human
nature.</p>

<p class="indent">So it is obvious that I watched Schwartz
with my eyes skinned. I sized up the situation
this way. Schwartz meant to press the
Old Man just a little short of breaking point,
and was far more anxious to bring about an
agreement than he permitted to be seen. I
was aching to give the Guv&rsquo;nor a pointer,
but I couldn&rsquo;t, as my acquaintance with English
is peculiar, and he is not able to catch
on my meaning like Minkie. If only he had
raised Schwartz before the draw, as they say
in poker, his adversary would not have been
so sure of his cards. As it was, he tried to
evade the final struggle.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said, with a brave attempt
at a smile, &ldquo;this is a poor way to spend Christmas
night. Suppose we adjourn to the drawing-room
now, and try to forget for a while
that mines may be bottomless pits.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Schwartz was well content to leave it at that.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;May I have my letter?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">The Guv&rsquo;nor handed it to him, but it was
not yet refolded when Minkie burst into the
room.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Please come, dad!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;And
you, too, Mr. Schwartz! Jim says that the
house is simply surrounded by black men.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, Schwartz had no grit in him:
his type of man never has. He went pale,
shook a bit, and leaned back against the
table, and I noticed that the letter fell from
his fingers to the floor. After a breathless
question or two from the men as to what Jim
meant by his extraordinary statement, they
all rushed out. I turned a couple of summersaults,
and was about to sing &ldquo;Tell me, pretty
maiden,&rdquo; when I saw a sharp snout thrust
inquiringly round the jamb of the door. It
was the mongoose.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;Welcome, little stranger,&rdquo; I said, but he
didn&rsquo;t seem to grasp idioms quickly, so I gave
him the only chunk of Hindustani I possess.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Jao! you soor-ka-butcha,&rdquo; I shouted.
One of my sailor friends says that is a polite
way of asking after another gentleman&rsquo;s
health, but the mongoose looked up at me
and wanted to know (in proper animalese)
why I was calling him names.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;But you did,&rdquo; he retorted.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t mean to. I thought that
when the first mate said that to a lascar he
meant &lsquo;Wot oh, &rsquo;ow&rsquo;s yer pore feet?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t use words you don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo;
said Rikki, quite sharp.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Keep your wool on; you&rsquo;ll need it before
the frost breaks. What&rsquo;s this I hear about
niggers outside? Are they after the fowls?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Dan says they want to kidnap Schwartz.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Look here, young fuzzy-wuzzy, not so
free with your &lsquo;Dan&rsquo; and &lsquo;Schwartz.&rsquo; You
haven&rsquo;t joined the Gang until I pass you.
Just try to remember that. Nice thing!
You&rsquo;ll be addressing me as &lsquo;Poll&rsquo; next, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>suppose? Now, if you want to make yourself
useful, pick up that piece of paper on the
carpet near the leg of the table, and carry it
into your cage. Mind you don&rsquo;t eat it. Miss
Millicent may want it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Is that Minkie?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;There you go again. &lsquo;Minkie,&rsquo; indeed,
and you not two hours in the house!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, if you behave yourself properly I&rsquo;ll
forgive you this time. Before you go, kindly
pass those nuts from the sideboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;What kind of nuts are they?&rdquo; said Rikki,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Brazil. They&rsquo;re rank poison for mongooses.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; He leaped up and gazed at the
dish. &ldquo;Shabsh!&rdquo; he said, cracking one.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re good eating.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shabsh you,&rdquo; I screamed. &ldquo;Help!
Thieves! Hi, hi, hi! Oh, mother, look at
Dick!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the row now?&rdquo; demanded Tib,
trotting in from the hall.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Tib, if you love me, chase that red-haired
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>vagabond away from my nuts,&rdquo; I implored
her.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s always the same old song with
you,&rdquo; she grinned. &ldquo;Any one would think
you were being murdered. Rikki is really
doing you a good turn, Poll. Too many nuts
are bad for you. Evangeline said so.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Ingratitood, thy name is cat! I fairly
boiled over. I even called Evangeline such
things that she came running in with a stick.
And, of course, she never saw that cunning
fox, Rikki. He sneaked out while she was
beating me, but he took the letter with him,
and I wouldn&rsquo;t be the least bit astonished if
he told Minkie he had done it off his own
bat.</p>

<p class="indent">Exactly why Minkie brought the Guv&rsquo;nor
and Schwartz out of the dining-room in such
a whirl I never discovered. She would have
told me in a minute if I had thought of asking
her, but things happened at such a rate
during the next few days that I had plenty to
do to keep track of current events without
bothering my head over ancient history. I
fancy she disturbed their conversation purposely.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>She knew Schwartz was in a desperate
mood, and would endeavor to force
her father to serve his ends. Mam&rsquo;s statement,
too, backed up by Dorothy&rsquo;s hints and
the plain tale she had read in the newspaper,
gave her an all-round glimpse of the facts concerning
Kwantus, and Dan was quite right
when he said that Minkie had invoked the
ju-ju&rsquo;s aid in a plan for the undoing of
Schwartz. She told us what it was when we
all met in the stable on Boxing Day, but, of
course, you will excuse me for not mentioning
it yet. To be candid, I daren&rsquo;t. We renewed
the vow of the Gang in solemn state, and Rikki
was sworn in as a new member at the same
time. He was admitted thus promptly on
account of his services with regard to that
letter, which was a jolly sight more important
than it sounded, and I must say he behaved
rather handsomely, because he not only gave
me full credit for the suggestion that he should
nab it, but he told me privately he was sorry
about those nuts.</p>

<p class="indent">Our vow is a jolly serious affair. We bind
ourselves to be loyal to the Gang &ldquo;by hoof
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>and claw, by beak and tooth, in air, on earth,
and in water.&rdquo; Each member pledges himself
or herself to &ldquo;sink all private feud the instant
any other member is threatened by an
external enemy, whether with two, three, or
four legs.&rdquo; We also promise to be loyal to
our leader Minkie, and to protect and help all
inmates of Holly Lodge, and, in token of
fealty and allegiance, each of us has to hold
up a foot or claw.</p>

<p class="indent">Dan, naturally, tried to be clever, and suggested
that the words &ldquo;or itself&rdquo; should be
inserted after the word &ldquo;herself,&rdquo; on the
ground that no one knew the sex of a zygodactyl;
he could not meet my eye, and pretended
to snigger, but Minkie told him not to be rude.
It may surprise some people to hear that we
made common cause against three-legged adversaries,
but that is easily explained. One
day last summer, while Jim was washing Bob
in the yard, and Dan was routing among some
plant pots for a rat, a travelling menagerie
passed our house, and a kangaroo leaped over
the garden wall and landed in the midst of
us. My cage was slung to the walnut tree,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>and I was so scared that I fell from my perch.
Dan, with all his faults, is certainly a courageous
beast, because he sprang at the stranger,
and received a kick that knocked him clean
over the cucumber frame. Jim fell into the
pail, but Bob whisked round and gave the
kangaroo a postman&rsquo;s double tap on the ribs
that sent him flying back to his caravan. Dan,
who was furious, alleged that the beast used
his tail as a leg, and never touched the ground
with his fore-legs at all. Jim bore out his
statement, so the vow brought in the three-legged
variety, to make sure.</p>

<p class="indent">I asked if Evangeline were included in the
word &ldquo;inmates,&rdquo; and Minkie said it was a
frivolous question. I quite agree with her.
Holly Lodge isn&rsquo;t a lunatic asylum.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet any outsider might be pardoned the
mistake if he heard our light-headed housemaid
telling Cookie the things she saw when
she went to the post, just before she beat me
with a cane. <i>I</i> know that post. It is a gate-post,
and it has a young man leaning against
it.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Fust one nigger kem past, an&rsquo; his eyes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>rolled something &rsquo;orrible,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Then
two kem from the hoppo-site direction, an&rsquo;
their eyes rolled wuss nor the other&rsquo;s. &lsquo;Tell
you wot, Lena,&rsquo; Bill said to me, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like
this. I&rsquo;m for &rsquo;ome,&rsquo; and he left me standin&rsquo;
there, with all those orful blacks prowlin&rsquo;
round like lions. Did you ever &rsquo;ear of such a
thing? I&rsquo;m finished with Bill; I wouldn&rsquo;t
look at him again not if he had twenty milk-walks.
I ran for my life, an&rsquo; found Jim. He
whistled Dan, an&rsquo; it did me good to see the
way that dorg began to clear the road, but Jim
called him orf, &rsquo;cause he says a nigger has as
much right to live as any other sort of man,
and those fellows were a-behavin&rsquo; of themselves.
That&rsquo;s as may be; if there&rsquo;s much
more of these goin&rsquo;s on &rsquo;ere I give my month&rsquo;s
notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">What do you think of that for a School
Board education? If I couldn&rsquo;t talk better
than Evangeline I&rsquo;d borrow some black-lead
and set up as a jack daw.</p>

<p class="indent">It seems that the Old Man and Schwartz
did not come across any negroes. Probably
Dan had frightened them, if Prince John had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>told his friends what sort of a Rugger tackle
Dan could put up. But Minkie is sharp,
dreadful sharp. The moment I mentioned
Jim&rsquo;s remark to Evangeline, she fastened on
to it instantly. Jim was washing the victoria
in the coach-house, and she went straight to
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;When did you last meet Prince John?&rdquo;
she inquired, planting her feet well apart, and
holding her hands behind her back. She
wore her blue serge that morning, and had a
beaver hat set well clear of her forehead. As
the weather was cold, though fine, she had
tight-fitting brown gaiters over her strong
boots, and she looked fit for any game that
might present itself.</p>

<p class="indent">Jim shuffled from one foot to the other, and
scratched the tip of his ear.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly remember, miss,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Take time, James. There is no hurry.
Just think.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, it might ha&rsquo; bin at the Marquis o&rsquo;
Granby; yesterday after tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And what did he say?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;He said it was a powerful shame a furriner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>should come to a British colony an&rsquo; steal a
thing which a lot o&rsquo; pore blacks thought more
of than anybody could imagine.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And then he paid for another round of
beer?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, miss, if you put it that way&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And he asked you to search for his black
bag, and particularly for a little ivory doll
which was inside it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Why, <i>you</i> must ha&rsquo; bin talkin&rsquo; to him, too,
miss!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No, James. I&rsquo;m just guessing. What
did you say to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see any harm in tellin&rsquo; him that
there was no sich thing anywheres in our
grounds, an&rsquo; Evangeline is sure it isn&rsquo;t in Mr.
Schwartz&rsquo;s bedroom.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Do you think it quite right, James, to go
to the Marquis o&rsquo; Granby and discuss our
affairs with a negro in a public bar?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pardon me, miss, but that ain&rsquo;t a
fair way of puttin&rsquo; it. This prince chap an&rsquo;
the rest of us had a rough an&rsquo; tumble on
Christmas Eve, an&rsquo; I slung him out of the
front gate all fair an&rsquo; square. It was a perfectly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>nateral thing to meet &rsquo;im afterwards an&rsquo;
&rsquo;ave a friendly chat over a pint.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;All right. The matter remains between
you and me. But I want you to promise that
if Prince John, or any other negro, approaches
you again, and tries to get information, you
will tell me everything at the first opportunity.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Of course, miss, I promise that. You
can&rsquo;t think I would go agin the people in Holly
Lodge, can you?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Applause from the stable. Even Rikki
joined in with his squeak, though he could
hardly make out what Jim was saying. Nevertheless,
Minkie had not finished with our
unhappy groom yet. I was glad to hear Jim
getting it. He grumbles every time he puts
fresh sand in my cage.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Did you arrange to meet him to-day?&rdquo;
she demanded.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes, miss,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;When and where?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, I said as &rsquo;ow the carriage might not
be wanted after five, an&rsquo; I would walk to the
other side of the green, when there would not
be so many people about.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;And what were you to tell him?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, just any gossip that was goin&rsquo;,
especially about Mr. Schwartz.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And how much did he promise to give
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Jim looked rather sheepish. His skin is
the color of a brick, but I fancy he took on a
beet-root tinge.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I believe a sovereign was mentioned, miss,&rdquo;
he admitted.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Here is your sovereign, James. Please
oblige me by not meeting Prince John to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t take it. I really can&rsquo;t; not
from you, Miss Millicent. Why, I could
never look you in the face again.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Take it, please. It is not my money.
You know very well that I have no sovereigns
to give away. And, when you meet the
prince, I want you to tell him plainly that you
must not hold any further conversation with
him. If my father knew of yesterday&rsquo;s talk
he would be exceedingly angry.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I thought that already, miss. Blest if I
can imagine how <i>you</i> found out so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>
<p class="indent">I laughed. I was the only member of the
Gang, except Minkie, who saw how important
was Evangeline&rsquo;s yarn to Cookie. Dan was
very sore about what he called Jim&rsquo;s treachery,
but Bob told him not to be a fool. &ldquo;When
the beer is in the wit is out,&rdquo; he said, and Bob
ought to know, as he soaked up gallons of it
while the Guv&rsquo;nor and Mam and Dorothy
were in Ostend last summer.</p>

<p class="indent">All that day there was electricity in the atmosphere.
Tibbie said she felt it in her fur.
Everybody in the village could speak of
nothing else but the extraordinary collection
of negroes who had invaded what the guidebook
calls &ldquo;a peaceful retreat.&rdquo; At last,
even the local policeman became aware that
something unusual was taking place, and he
strolled majestically up our drive to make
inquiries.</p>

<p class="indent">The Guv&rsquo;nor met him, and said Mr.
Schwartz&rsquo;s presence accounted for the sudden
access of color to the landscape.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;My friend has large interests in West
Africa,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;and the mere fact
that he is staying at Dale End has drawn to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>this neighborhood many natives who are at
present residing in England.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;From information received,&rdquo; quoth Robert,
&ldquo;I have reason to believe, sir, that a larceny
on your premises is intended by some of these
blacks.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Nonsense! That story has arisen owing
to one of them&rsquo;s thrusting himself in here on
Christmas Eve.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Schwartz asked the Old Man to head off
any police interference in that way. So the
law marched back to the village and took off
its belt. Yet every man, woman, and child
in Dale End resembled so many full soda
syphons: the moment you touched them they
spurted bubbles, and all the gas that escaped
was chat concerning our sable visitors. It
soon became known that there were three
negroes staying at the Manor, and four at the
Marquis o&rsquo; Granby. They had plenty of
money, which they spent freely; but there
could not be the slightest doubt that they were
hostile to us at Holly Lodge, and the maids at
the Marquis o&rsquo; Granby spread the story that
the blacks had some awful-looking choppers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>among their luggage. From the description
I recognized these as machetes.</p>

<p class="indent">When Schwartz accompanied Dorothy to
her old nurse&rsquo;s cottage during the afternoon,
some idiot told two negroes who were standing
at the door of the inn that the millionaire
was just walking across the green with Miss
Grosvenor. The black men muttered something,
rolled their eyes in a manner that would
have given Evangeline hysterics, and dogged
the couple all the way back to our place.</p>

<p class="indent">That started a rumor of attempted murder
which set the village in an uproar, and there
was some danger of an attack on the strangers
until P. C. Banks gave his personal assurance
that Mr. Grosvenor himself had said the
negroes were perfectly harmless. Altogether,
Boxing Day was lively. I began to think of
old times in South America, when we had a
revolution every twenty-four hours, and I
used to ask the baker each morning, &ldquo;Who is
President to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">But the night passed without any special
incident. I had a few words with the mongoose
after dinner because I chanced to call
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>him &ldquo;Mickey&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Rikki,&rdquo; and Dan
and Tib had a spar about some cutlet bones;
such breezes, however, are not uncommon in
the best families, and, in distinct contrast with
us, harmony reigned in the drawing-room,
where Schwartz made himself agreeable to
all parties, even to Minkie.</p>

<p class="indent">Picture to yourself, then, the terrific excitement
which sprang up next day at luncheon-time
when Minkie was missing! I first heard
of it from Dan, who rushed in and yelped:</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Have you seen Minkie anywhere?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, breathlessly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Here.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;At breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Goose!&rdquo; he hissed, and ran out again.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, I was only taking a rise out of
him. I had no notion that his search was
serious until I heard Mam weeping when the
Guv&rsquo;nor came back after driving all round
the village, and calling at every house he could
think of.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, Tom,&rdquo; she sobbed, crying as if her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>heart would break, &ldquo;if any harm has befallen
our darling I shall not survive it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Why do you take such a gloomy view of a
trivial absence from home?&rdquo; he asked, though
his voice did not bear out the carelessness of
his words. &ldquo;You know well enough what an
extraordinary child Millicent is. We can
never tell what queer thing she may be doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Mam was not to be comforted in that way.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Millicent has always asked permission if
she wished to be away at meal time, and
Dandy is not with her. I would not be so
frightened if the dog had gone, too. Tom,
what shall we do if she is not home before it
is dark? I shall go mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Dorothy was weeping also, and I heard
Evangeline snivel something about them there
black villains as was up to no good, she was
sure. That was the worst thing she could
have said. Mam simply refused to remain
in the house when the light failed. She was
going to ask Captain Stanhope&rsquo;s help, she
declared. He knew a good deal about these
negroes, and she was certain he would move
heaven and earth to discover Minkie&rsquo;s whereabouts,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>because he loved the child as if she
were his own sister.</p>

<p class="indent">The Guv&rsquo;nor saw that Mam was not fit to
venture out, so he persuaded her to let him
go to the Manor and see Jack. Schwartz,
who was really beside himself with anxiety,
tried hard to console Mam and Dorothy
during the Guv&rsquo;nor&rsquo;s absence, though he personally
was in a fine pickle which they knew
nothing of.</p>

<p class="indent">He was afraid Minkie had been attacked,
either on account of the ju-ju or the money
he had given her, but he simply dared not
say anything about his suspicions. At last,
after an hour that had a thousand minutes,
the Guv&rsquo;nor returned. Mam saw by her
first glance at his face that he brought bad
news. She gave a deep sigh, and fainted
clean away.</p>

<p class="indent">I heard Bob telling Dan something outside,
but I was forced to listen to what the Guv&rsquo;nor
was saying to Schwartz, while Dorothy and
Evangeline and Cookie were trying to revive
Mam.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad business, I fear,&rdquo; he whispered,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>holding on to the back of a chair like a man
who thinks he may fall. &ldquo;I met Stanhope
and his uncle at the Manor, and even the
older Stanhope was aghast when I told him
my errand. It was the first they had heard
of Minkie&rsquo;s disappearance, and Jack is now
procuring the arrest of every negro in Dale
End.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I would like to burn them alive,&rdquo; broke
in Schwartz, and he meant it, too, for he was
on the rack.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;But that is not all,&rdquo; went on the Old Man
hoarsely. &ldquo;My poor little girl was seen talking
to one of these devils last evening, at
dusk, at the further end of the green. And
to-day, the moment the Bank was open, she
changed a fifty-pound note. There can be
no doubt about it. The manager himself
told me. Of course, he thought the money
was mine. God in heaven! what does it all
mean, and what has become of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Schwartz sat down, and bent his head. He
gave it up. He didn&rsquo;t know what to do.
Neither did I. I was acquainted with Minkie&rsquo;s
plan, but, so far as I could see, it had nothing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>in it which was likely to keep her away from
home.</p>

<p class="indent">No wonder people in Dale End called that
a Black Christmas. It was nearly being a
fiery one also, because others in the village
shared Schwartz&rsquo;s idea, and it was actually
proposed that the police-station should be
burnt down and the negroes roasted inside it.
Isn&rsquo;t there a proverb about scratching a
Russian and finding a Tartar? Well, to my
thinking, you will not find such a world of
difference between Surrey and Alabama when
a black man is suspected of doing away with
a white girl.</p>

<p class="indent">And our Minkie, too! Oh, look here, I&rsquo;m
off into the Latin tongues. I can&rsquo;t express
my feelings in pure Anglo-Saxon. Give me
a torch and a bucket of tar; I&rsquo;ll find the
feathers! <i>Saperlotte!</i> What was it Giovanni
used to say?</p>

<p class="ph3">THE UNDOING OF SCHWARTZ</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>Told by Minkie</i></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> SUPPOSE it was very wrong of me to
leave home without warning. Mam says
that if I had told her what I meant to do she
would have been spared all anxiety. Of
course, Mam means that <i>now</i>; my own private
impression is that all sorts of objections
might have occurred to her <i>then</i>; and any interference
with my plan might have upset
things altogether. However, if I tell the
story in my own way, you will see I had
several good reasons for acting as I did. One
of my copy-books had a head-line: &ldquo;It is
a dangerous yet true axiom that the end justifies
the means,&rdquo; and I never understood that
sentence until I read in a paper how a clever
little boy had extinguished a fire in a bedroom
by pulling a plug out of the cistern in
<span class="pagenum padpage" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>an attic overhead. Had there been no fire,
that clever little boy would have got spanked.
See?</p>

<p class="indent">And there was no time to be lost. Seven
powerful negroes had not come to Dale End
for amusement. They meant mischief. Without
going so far as killing us all in our beds,
they could easily have attacked the house and
held us up, as they say in America, until the
ju-ju was found. They were not afraid of
the law; six of them were ready to go to prison
provided the seventh got clear away with their
funny little god. And what would Mam have
thought then? And Evangeline? And what
would Polly have said?</p>

<p class="indent">Jim, too, was in league with our own maids
to search everywhere for the ju-ju. Isn&rsquo;t it
odd that you can&rsquo;t trust your fellow-mortals?
Dan, or Bob, or Tib would die sooner than
play the sneak; even that sarcastic old parrot
would never betray the Gang, and little Rikki,
though he is a newcomer, is with us tooth and
nail. Anyhow, what between Schwartz and
the servants inside, and Prince John and his
tribesman outside, I made up my mind to act
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>a bit sooner than I intended. Perhaps the
ju-ju egged me on also. You never can tell.
The mysteries of fetish-worship are beyond
me.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, <i>I</i> kept Jim&rsquo;s appointment with
the African Prince. It was nearly dark when
I crossed the green, and there were four
negroes standing in the road near the Manor
gate. They were all much of a size, and I
thought I should not be able to recognize the
man who came to our house. But I spotted
him at once. There must be something in
being born a ruler, even a savage one. Prince
John was quite different to the others in his
manners and appearance. I was sorry he
wore English clothes. It would have been
fine if he were stalking about in feathers and
a leopard skin, though I expect, poor fellow,
he would have caught his death of cold.</p>

<p class="indent">The four paid no heed to me until I stopped
and said &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">That made them look at me, and Prince
John said: &ldquo;Have you a message for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">He thought I was some girl from the village,
but I quickly put him right on that point.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Come here. I wish
to speak to you alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he knew me, as he had heard me talking
to Dad on our way from the station in the
victoria. He advanced a few steps.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;one of Mr. Grosvenor&rsquo;s
daughters? I remember. My ankle is still
stiff where you held it. You must have strong
hands, for a child. Now, what can I do for
you? Have you brought me what I seek?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">He spoke as if he were a king, not a bit like
the affected drawl of our local M.P. when he
opens a bazaar, but it was necessary that I
should make him jump, so I replied, rather
off-handedly:</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It all depends on the price you are willing
to pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">That fetched him like a shot. He came
quite close and looked down at me eagerly.
I could see the whites of his eyes, and they
reminded me of a pollywog, but I kept a
straight face.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Do you mean to say you have found a bit
of carved ivory, with a monkey&rsquo;s head and a
little beaded skirt? If so, girl, give it to me,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>and I will reward you with a handful of gold,&rdquo;
he cried.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I have not got your ju-ju in my possession
at this moment,&rdquo; I said, speaking slowly, and
watching him as intently as Dan watches the
mouth of a burrow when he hears the rabbits
squeaking at the sight of a ferret. &ldquo;But I am
fairly certain I can lay my hand on it, on
terms.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Terms! Anything you ask! What is
your price? Take me with you now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Not so fast, Prince John,&rdquo; said I, drawing
away a foot or so&mdash;because a negro does look
rather horrid when you are too near him, although
he may only be showing animation,
which, in his case, means teeth&mdash;&ldquo;there is
nothing to be gained by hurry. You can&rsquo;t
have your ju-ju to-night, but you may have it
to-morrow night, provided you are willing to
pay my father exactly half the sum you offered
Mr. Schwartz.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">My heart beat a trifle faster when the words
were out. Jack did not mention the amount.
It might have been a few hundred pounds, or
several thousands. I imagined it was a tolerably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>large figure, or Schwartz would not have
been so ready to hand me fifty pounds for the
mere expenses.</p>

<p class="indent">Prince John did not hesitate a second.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;yet surely Mr. Grosvenor
has not sent <i>you</i> to arrange such an
important matter with <i>me</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">He might have been his own ju-ju addressing
a black-beetle, or Lord Kitchener talking
to a tin soldier, but I didn&rsquo;t budge another
inch. What I wanted to know was the price.
So I made him jump again.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Mr. Grosvenor knows nothing whatever
about it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;This affair is absolutely
between you and me, and must remain so until
you bring the money to our house to-morrow
evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Do I understand that the ju-ju is in your
hands, that no one else is aware of the fact,
and that you alone are in treaty with me for
its restoration?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">I caught the change in his voice. If I
hadn&rsquo;t a well-trained ear I could never distinguish
the various shades of meaning in the
speech of other members of the Gang, because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>they really don&rsquo;t use words, you know, but
just sounds which tell me what they want to
say. After all, that is talking, in a sense.
And his prince-ship forgot he was in Surrey.
Perhaps, like me, when I read an exciting
book, he fancied himself far away, in a land
where a big yellow river gurgles through a
swamp all dark with trees, and a hundred
thousand black men were ready to do anything
he commanded. Anyhow, <i>I</i> wasn&rsquo;t
black.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You have stated the facts,&rdquo; I answered
coolly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t it somewhat daring? Are you
not afraid? You are a small English girl,
and we are big, strong Africans. You are
taking a great risk, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Again he came nearer, but I stood my
ground, though he could not tell that my nails
were digging into the palms of my hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I am English, of course, though not so
small,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and I am so perfectly well
aware you are an African that I have arranged
for your ju-ju to be burnt to ashes unless I am
home at six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i>Parbleu!</i> as mademoiselle used to forbid
me to say, though it only means &ldquo;By blue!&rdquo; he
altered his tune mighty sharp, or it would be
more correct to put it that he came back with
a flop from the Upper Niger to Dale End.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It is very extraordinary,&rdquo; he muttered,
&ldquo;but I cannot bring myself to disbelieve you.
Captain Stanhope said that if you were
friendly to us, something might be done. I
accept your proposal. Hand over my property
and I, in return, will hand your father five
thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">There! It was out. You know what it is
like when you wade into the sea and take your
first header through a curling breaker. That
is how I felt. Something buzzed in my ears,
but I was determined to keep control over
my voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;In notes?&rdquo; I managed to say.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Certainly. One does not carry such sums
in gold. I have the money here; I was prepared,
as you are aware, to pay Mr. Schwartz
twice as much. But what guarantee have I
that you will not sell the ju-ju to him for a
higher amount?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You have my word, and the knowledge
that I came to you of my own free will.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Your groom told you I would be here?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, I trust you. What time shall I
come to your house?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;At nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I warn you I am in no mood to be tricked
in this matter. You see those men there?&rdquo;
and he glanced over his shoulder towards the
other negroes. &ldquo;They will face death cheerfully
to gain our common object.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You may rely on what I have said.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Thank you. Yet it is amazing, quite
amazing.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">I thought so, too. But I wanted some information,
and I had to hurry, as it was growing
late.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Your people are Kwantus, aren&rsquo;t they?
Have you ever heard of the Kwantu mine?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Of course I have. It is in my kingdom.
Schwartz owns it, the thief.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Well, I never! I did gasp a bit at that.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; I was forced to say.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Who should know better than I? It is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>the best mine in West Africa. The price of
the shares shows that its value is appreciated
by others, though I cannot understand how
so much is known in England about it, as it
has hardly been opened up. Schwartz obtained
the concession solely because we hoped
he would give us back our ju-ju.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Yet I had in my pocket a letter from some
Stock Exchange people to Schwartz himself,
telling him they could not ascertain the name
of the real owner! That was the letter Rikki
secured at Polly&rsquo;s bidding, and hid in his cage.</p>

<p class="indent">Somehow, it seemed to prove that Schwartz
was really the bad man Prince John made
him out to be. I did not quite grasp the
meaning of it all, though I was sure that dear
old Dad was being swindled, but with fifty-three
pounds nineteen and sixpence in my
pocket, and five thousand pounds as good
as paid to father, and the ju-ju safe in the
scullery copper, where Evangeline would light
a fire after supper, it would be queer if I failed
to bring Schwartz to reason. Besides, I meant
to secure the assistance of an older head than
mine, as this company business rather bothered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>me, and I was too young to be well up in
&ldquo;squeezes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">My new friend lifted his hat with a grand
air when I said &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo; I walked
away quietly, and I heard such a hubbub of
strange talk when Prince John rejoined his
companions.</p>

<p class="indent">I met two other negroes on the road across
the green. I fancied they were watching the
turning to the railway station to make sure
that Schwartz did not leave Holly Lodge without
their knowledge. At any rate, I determined
to take no risks next morning, as it was
more than probable Prince John would tell
his confederates of the new power behind the
ju-ju.</p>

<p class="indent">That night, in my locked bedroom, I examined
the little idol very carefully. It was
roughly carved; the ivory was yellow with
age, and covered with tiny cracks, which
looked like a net of fine hair. The skirt was
made of a sort of hemp, plaited together, with
a small colored bead between each knot. It
was just a strip of beaded cloth, which lapped
over at the joint, and was held in position by a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>piece of string. The beads differed from any
I had ever seen, but I was almost certain the
monkey&rsquo;s eyes were emeralds, but not good
ones, as Mam has a nice emerald and diamond
ring, so I know.</p>

<p class="indent">I don&rsquo;t mind telling you now that I was half
afraid of the thing. It seemed to be quite
absurd that so many grown men should be
willing to kill each other for its ownership.
One might imagine a baby crying for it, because
babies always prefer the most disreputable
wooden horse or dirtiest rag doll, but it
made one&rsquo;s hair tingle to think of war, and
money, and good or bad fortune for goodness
knows how many people, depending on the
whereabouts of this eight-inch piece of tusk.
Worst of all, I was beginning to believe in it.
It seemed to squint at me in a chummy way
with its wicked little eyes. Before I so much
as heard of its existence or knew its name it
brought me luck, just because it was lying in
Schwartz&rsquo;s portmanteau in the carriage. You
will remember I touched Schwartz for five
pounds in five minutes on Christmas Eve.
On Christmas Day I got fifty out of him, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>now Prince John was ready to give me five
thousand. I couldn&rsquo;t help wondering if it
would keep up the pace, and add another
nought each day I held it.</p>

<p class="indent">And that made me feel rather horrid, so I
stuffed it out of sight under the bolster, and
said my prayers; then the creeps passed away,
and I fell asleep.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a sunshiny frost when I awoke, and
every tree and shrub in the garden was decked
with sparkling gems. Evangeline seemed to
be annoyed when I unlocked the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Nice thing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;makin&rsquo; me bump
me nose in that fashion!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Dan came in with her, and I found that she
had clattered along with the hot water without
looking where she was going. Of course,
the door didn&rsquo;t yield as usual, so her head
struck the panel.</p>

<p class="indent">Dan and I laughed, and Evangeline rubbed
her nose with a black finger. Then we
laughed some more, and Evangeline looked
at herself in the glass.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all be niggers in this house soon,&rdquo;
she declared in a rage, and slammed out.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the game to-day?&rdquo; said Dan,
sitting on his tail.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Nothing more than yesterday,&rdquo; I answered.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I told the parrot that, but the blessed bird
is swinging on his perch and roaring something
about another revolution.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;What does he mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s talking Spanish, I believe. The few
words I could make sense of showed that he
regarded last night&rsquo;s general contentment as
the calm before the storm.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you are only two years
old. Polly is twenty, at the least. If you
count up you will find that he is ten times
wiser than you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Dan looked at me suspiciously. After thinking
for a minute or two and scratching hard
on the back of his head, he got me to let him
out. When I came down to breakfast I discovered
him listening to Polly, who was singing
extracts from the latest musical comedies.
The instant I appeared Polly became silent.
He clung to the wires sideways, and watched
me steadily, first with one eye and then with
the other. Even Tibbie sat blinking at me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
from the hearth-rug, and when I went round
to the stable, dear old Bob turned in his stall
and stared at me solemnly. Talk about a
ju-ju, the Gang can read my very thoughts!</p>

<p class="gap">&#160;</p>

<div class="figcenter bbox" style="width:400px;">
<img src="images/i165.jpg" width="400" height="575" alt="My first call was at a jeweller&rsquo;s in Piccadilly" title="" id="i165" />
</div>

<div class="gap">&nbsp;</div>

<p class="indent">Dan and Tibbie and Rikki began to follow
at my heels, and it grieved me very much to
be compelled to shut them up in the coach-house.
But I had to do it. I put on my
beaver hat and an astrachan jacket, went
out through the front gate, doubled down the
paddock, crossed the fir plantation, and made
my way by a field path to Breckonhurst, the
next station to Dale End. I took a return
ticket to London, remained in the waiting-room
until a train came in, and then popped
quickly into the nearest empty carriage. At
Waterloo I sat in the train until the other
passengers had quitted the platform. After
that, I took my chance of not being recognized.</p>

<p class="indent">My first call was at a jeweller&rsquo;s in Piccadilly.
I showed him the ju-ju, and asked him
what the beads were. He screwed a funny-shaped
glass into his right eye and examined
them.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;They are different varieties of chalcedony,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>he said. &ldquo;There are agates, carnelians, cat&rsquo;s
eyes, onyx, sards, and three kinds of flints in
this collection.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, looking curiously
at the idol.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;A jou-jou,&rdquo; I answered, blessing mademoiselle
inwardly.</p>

<p class="indent">The man didn&rsquo;t speak French, so I told him
<i>jou-jou</i> meant &ldquo;toy,&rdquo; and that satisfied him.
We had some more talk, and I am sure I surprised
him, but he was very civil, and took no
end of trouble to discover an address I wanted.
It turned out to be a little street off Tottenham
Court Road. I drove there in a hansom,
remained ten minutes, and hired the same
cab back to the West-end. The cabman
wanted to charge me four shillings, but I gave
him half-a-crown and looked for his number.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;S&rsquo;elp me!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;wot&rsquo;s things a-comin&rsquo;
to?&rdquo; And, with that, he whipped his
poor horse into a canter, which is the nasty,
vindictive way that sort of man has of expressing
his feelings.</p>

<p class="indent">Then I had a real slice of luck. I met Mr.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>Warden, my father&rsquo;s solicitor, just coming
out of his office. He was quite taken aback
at seeing me, especially when he found that
Dad or Mam was not with me, and my good
fortune was that had I been a few seconds
later I should have missed him, as he was
going to join Mrs. Warden in Brighton, having
simply run up to town for an hour to
glance at his letters. I was sorry for Mrs.
Warden, but I had to keep him.</p>

<p class="indent">Although he was a lawyer, and a very smart
one, Dad says, he did open his eyes wide when
I got fairly started with my story. I told him
everything, or nearly everything, and the only
bits that puzzled him were my references to
Dan, or Bob, or Tib. As for what the parrot
said, or Rikki did, he was too polite to smile,
but he kept balancing his gold-rimmed spectacles
on his nose, and pressing the tips of his
fingers together, until I thought it best not to
mention the Gang any more, because they
seemed to bother him.</p>

<p class="indent">But, oh my, didn&rsquo;t he look serious when I
showed him the letter from Schwartz&rsquo;s brokers,
and told him about the &ldquo;squeeze&rdquo; in Kwantus!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>He asked me if I knew what paper I
got my information from, and I said &ldquo;yes,&rdquo;
so he tinkled a little bell and sent a clerk to
buy a copy in Fleet-street. I was not sure
about the date, but the clerk, who was such
a nice boy, said he could search the file.</p>

<p class="indent">By the time I had finished, the clerk returned
with the newspaper. Mr. Warden
changed his spectacles, and said &ldquo;Hum&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Ha&rdquo; several times while he was reading the
paragraph. Then he put on the gold ones
again, and gazed at me.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You are a very remarkable girl, Millicent,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I suppose my story sounds odd,&rdquo; I answered,
&ldquo;but it all happened exactly as I have
told you, and there is hardly anything that
takes place in Dale End which the Gang cannot
form a reliable opinion about.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;The Gang?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I beg your pardon, I meant my animal
friends, but, of course, you don&rsquo;t quite believe
in them.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I believe that you talk to them, and thus
teach yourself to express your views very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>clearly. At any rate, we can let that pass.
May I see this phenomenon of a ju-ju?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">I smiled, because I was expecting him to say
that.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind,&ldquo; I explained, &rdquo;I would
rather show it to you in the train this evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;This evening? Are we not going to Dale
End at once?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I shall not be ready until nearly six o&rsquo;clock.
I have a lot of things to do. Are you quite
sure you will meet me at the station?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">He was positive, he said, but he was distressed
at the notion that I should be hours
and hours alone in London, so the nice young
clerk was ordered to take care of me. I led
him rather a dance, and the way I spent
Schwartz&rsquo;s gold seemed to give him a pain.
Mr. Warden promised to telegraph to Mam
to tell her I was quite safe, and that we should
both be home about seven, but he was so
astounded by my adventures that he wrote
Southend in place of Dale End, and the telegram
reached us in a letter two days later,
with Mr. Warden&rsquo;s apologies. Do you know,
I am convinced the ju-ju had something to do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>with that. If Schwartz had heard who Mr.
Warden was, he might have smelt a rat. And
isn&rsquo;t it odd, as Bob pointed out, that Southend
should come after West-end, and Dale End,
and Ostend and Mile End?</p>

<p class="indent">The clerk and I had lunch and tea together
and he insisted on paying, though I had ever
so much more money in my pocket than he.
By the time we reached Waterloo he looked
rather tired, because we took no more cabs,
and I went to lots of places I wanted to see,
so I bought him a box of cigarettes as a
present, and he said he hoped I would often
come to London on business.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Warden was waiting for me, and the
moment the guard set eyes on me he came
running up.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re here, are you, Miss Grosvenor?&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;A fine thing you&rsquo;ve bin and
gone and done. All Dale End is inquirin&rsquo;
after you, an&rsquo; your pore father is nearly
wild.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Warden gave him a shilling, saying it
was all right. But it wasn&rsquo;t. When we
reached our station, and began to walk to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>Lodge, as Bob was not there to meet us, every
person we met turned and followed us, until
there was quite a mob at our heels when we
crossed the green. We didn&rsquo;t know then that
Mr. Banks, our policeman, had all the negroes,
including Prince John, locked up in his tiny
police-station. Jack and several men from
the Manor were helping him to mount guard
over them until more policemen arrived, as
the Dale-enders wanted to lynch the black
men, which would have been a sad job for
everybody.</p>

<p class="indent">Our escort blocked the road in front of our
gate, but they did not venture to come inside
the grounds. Dan was the first to hear the
noise, and he barked. Then he caught my
step on the gravel, and Mam will never again
say that a dog can&rsquo;t speak, for he told her
quite plainly that I was coming.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, you can guess all the crying and kissing
that went on, and how Dad tried to be
angry while he took me in his arms, but Mr.
Warden spoke about the telegram, and declared
he would write to the <i>Times</i> and the
Postmaster General. Tib climbed up on my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>shoulder, and Rikki gave my hand such a
queer little lick, while Poll did several lightning
twists on the cross-bar, and whistled
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come home, Bill Bailey.&rdquo; I
heard dear Bob neighing in the stable, and I
went to kiss his velvety nose the first minute
I could spare.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Schwartz was really as delighted as
anybody that I had turned up, so he failed to
notice how cool Mr. Warden was when Dad
introduced them. I had hardly got my hat
and jacket off, and was hugging Mam for the
tenth time, when Dad called me into the
morning-room, where he and Schwartz and
Mr. Warden were standing.</p>

<p class="indent">Solicitors can be very sharp if they like,
and our lawyer surprised me with the way he
tackled Schwartz.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;My young friend here,&rdquo; he said, meaning
me, &ldquo;tells me she has promised to restore to
you a certain article known as a ju-ju, which
you lost on Christmas Eve.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Schwartz, quite calmly. You
see, he was a smart man of business, and I
suppose he was not afraid of lawyers, or he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>would not have been able to keep all the
money he was worth.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; went on Mr. Warden, &ldquo;she is prepared
to hand it to you in return for your
quittance of her father&rsquo;s obligation to find
you one thousand shares in the Kwantu
Mines, Limited.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">That staggered Schwartz somewhat, but he
said, in a husky voice: &ldquo;I fail to understand
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;That is a pity. I wish to avoid a scandal.
If you compel candor I shall be obliged to
tell you who is the real owner of that property,
and the law of England punishes fraudulent
conspiracy very heavily. The links in the
chain are quite complete; they even include
our possession of a letter to you from a certain
firm of brokers stating that they had
failed to discover the genuine proprietors of
the company.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; cried Dad, looking at Schwartz,
&ldquo;what is this? Are you sure of your facts,
Warden?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">I once read in a paper that some man who
was fighting another man &ldquo;went down and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>out.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t know what it meant, but it
seemed to fit Schwartz&rsquo;s case. He went limp
all at once.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Quite sure, Grosvenor,&rdquo; said the solicitor.
&ldquo;You can thank your daughter for putting
me on the track of a very discreditable and
unsavory business. I have prepared the necessary
documents, Mr. Schwartz. Will you
execute them without further explanation?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Where is the ju-ju?&rdquo; demanded Schwartz,
pulling himself together, and glaring at me
with eyes like flint marbles.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said I, hauling it out of my pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">He took it, held it in his left hand, and
signed the papers placed before him by the
lawyer. Dad signed, too, and Mr. Warden
witnessed the signatures. Not a word was
spoken. Schwartz went out of the room, and
Dad rang for Evangeline to tell Jim to get
the victoria ready at once.</p>

<p class="indent">When Schwartz drove through our gate on
his way to the station the mob cheered him.
I expect he felt like being cheered. Bob told
me afterwards that he said a naughty word
to our lame porter when he wanted to carry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>the small bag in which the ju-ju was placed,
I suppose, because gentlemen&rsquo;s pockets are
not like mine. Still, from what I heard later,
he must have taken it out of the bag when
he was safe in the train.</p>

<p class="indent">It was then nearly eight o&rsquo;clock, and Dad
sent Mole with a note to Jack to say that the
negroes ought to be liberated at once. Jack,
who has plenty of brains, brought his uncle
with him to congratulate Dad and Mam about
me, and they stayed to dinner. Jack and
Dorothy sat together, so matters looked all
right in that quarter. They did not say a
great deal. Just as in Schwartz&rsquo;s case, silence
was eloquent. Dad brought me once to see
a play at Drury Lane, and I imagined all sorts
of terrifying things when the villain crept
nearer the defenceless heroine. If either of
them spoke it was not half so thrilling. I had
just the same feeling when Mr. Warden kept
waiting for Schwartz to admit he was beaten.</p>

<p class="indent">Prince John rang our bell exactly at nine
o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Wah!&rdquo; shrieked Evangeline when she
opened the door. Then she fled. I had to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>rush and grab Dan, but I smiled sweetly at
my dark visitor, and asked him to come into
the morning-room. I knew that Mr. Warden
and Uncle Stanhope were telling each other
that every motorist should be sent to penal
servitude on a second conviction, so I had no
trouble in beckoning Dad to join me for a
minute.</p>

<p class="indent">He was rather surprised at meeting the
negro, but he apologized quite nicely for the
Christmas Eve incident, and also for any inconvenience
which the other might have undergone
owing to the action of the police. I was
wondering if Dad meant to put his hand in his
pocket and produce some money, but he told
me afterwards that he felt exactly the same as
I did with regard to Prince John. The man
looked every inch a king, and I have reckoned
up that he was at least seventy-four inches
high.</p>

<p class="indent">But, before I could stop him, Dad nearly
gave me away badly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I ought to tell you,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that,
from circumstances which have come to my
knowledge, I now sympathize deeply with you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>in your search for the&mdash;er&mdash;curious West
African&mdash;er&mdash;god which you wish to recover,
and I must say that if my&mdash;er&mdash;daughter
Millicent had consulted me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">So Dad was just beginning to tell the
Kwantu chief in his best J.P. manner that
Schwartz was again the proud possessor of
the ju-ju, when I broke in:</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;One moment, father dear,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;you
will understand things ever so much better
when you hear what Prince John and I have
to say to each other. Have you kept your
part of the bargain?&rdquo; I asked the black man
quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">He took from his coat pocket a small bundle
tied with pink tape.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Here are fifty Bank of England notes for
100 each,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Then here is your ju-ju,&rdquo; I answered,
diving into my skirt pocket, and handing him
the original piece of ivory, beaded kilt and all
complete, and you may now know what a
trouble it was to get a fair copy of it made for
Schwartz during the few hours I had at my
disposal in London.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>
<p class="indent">Dad looked awfully severe, after his first
gasp of amazement had passed.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Millicent,&ldquo; he said, &rdquo;what have you
done?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I have served Mr. Schwartz as he tried
to serve you, father dear,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;As
for Prince John, he offered the man who stole
the ju-ju ten thousand pounds if it were given
back, so I saw no harm in arranging that half
the amount should be paid to you. In any
case, I always meant the poor black people
to have it. It was a very great shame for Mr.
Schwartz to take from them a thing which
they thought so much of.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">For a little while he could say nothing.
Like me, he was watching the black prince,
who really treated that absurd&mdash;I mean that
extraordinary scrap of carved ivory, as if it
were the most precious article in the world.
It might have been all one blazing diamond
by the reverent way he handled it. When
he was quite sure that it was his own ju-ju&mdash;and
he did not take for granted, like Schwartz,
that it was the genuine thing until he had
looked at every mark&mdash;he pressed its funny
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>monkey face to his lips, his forehead, and his
breast. He paid not the least heed to us or
what we were saying. It was not until he had
produced a small, finely woven mat from the
pocket in which he kept the notes, and wrapped
the ju-ju in it before putting it away, that he
gave us any attention.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, Dad started a second time to
talk as if he were at a Conservative meeting.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It has given me the greatest pleasure to
observe that my&mdash;er&mdash;daughter Millicent
has restored to you the&mdash;er&mdash;interesting
object which you seem to value so highly, but I
need hardly say that&mdash;er&mdash;the payment of any
such&mdash;er&mdash;astounding reward as five thousand
pounds is utterly out of the question.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;My people pay the money gladly,&rdquo; said
the negro prince, dragging himself up in the
grandest way imaginable. &ldquo;I tell you, too,
that your daughter&rsquo;s name will be honored
in my country, and when I and my friends
return home we shall not fail to send her other
tokens of our regard and good will.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;We cannot accept this money,&rdquo; said Dad,
firmly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;It is quite essential that you should,&rdquo; said
the other with equal coolness. &ldquo;If you refuse
it now, I shall simply be compelled to
send it to you through the post. We lost our
ju-ju owing to the remissness of its guardians.
We must atone for that, and the payment must
be made in treasure&mdash;or blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">You can have no idea how he uttered those
last two words. He spoke quietly, and in a
low voice, but somehow I could feel in them
the edge of one of those sharp, heavy choppers&mdash;called
&ldquo;machetes,&rdquo; Polly says&mdash;which the
maids in the Marquis o&rsquo; Granby saw in the
negroes&rsquo; bedrooms.</p>

<p class="indent">So it ended in our shaking hands with Prince
John, and in Dad&rsquo;s bringing the notes into the
drawing-room to show them to Mam and the
others before he put them away in the silver
safe. Everybody made a tremendous fuss
over me, and Poll sang &ldquo;The man who broke
the Bank at Monte Carlo,&rdquo; but I was only
too delighted that we had had such a jolly
Christmas, and were all good friends again,
though it looked rather glum at one time.
They made me talk nearly all this story before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>I went to bed, and I heard old Mr. Stanhope
growl that if Dorothy was in such a hurry to
get married he didn&rsquo;t see why she shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p class="indent">Dad did not tell me until long after, but he
sent Mr. Schwartz his fifty-five pounds next
day, when he also bought me the loveliest bay
pony to ride. I christened him &ldquo;Prince
John&rdquo; when I introduced him to the gang.</p>

<p class="indent">And that reminds me. In the morning
paper the day afterwards, I found a most
exciting paragraph. I whistled Dan, took
Tibbie and Rikki under each arm, and asked
Mole to carry Poll&rsquo;s cage to the stable.</p>

<p class="indent">Bob and Prince John looked round in their
stalls to see what was the matter, and Bob
said:</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;What is it now? Has a North American
Indian arrived in Dale End, or what?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You listen,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I came across this
in the paper just now: &lsquo;An extraordinary
outrage was committed in the precincts of
Waterloo Station on Thursday evening&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Thursday evening!&rdquo; cried Tib. &ldquo;Why,
that&rsquo;s the evening Schwartz&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt,&rdquo; I said, and went on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>reading: &ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Montague Schwartz, the
well-known West African millionaire, was
leaving the station in a four-wheeled cab when
two gigantic negroes rushed to the near side
of the vehicle as it was descending the steep
slope into Waterloo Road, and threw it bodily
over.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; roared Dan, but I silenced him
with a look.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;&lsquo;The cabman was, of course, flung headlong
from his seat; Mr. Schwartz was imprisoned
inside, and ran grave risk of serious
injury owing to the plunging of the frightened
horse.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Silly creatures, some horses,&rdquo; observed
Poll, and Bob didn&rsquo;t like it, but I continued:</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;&lsquo;In the darkness and confusion no one
seems to have noticed the negroes, who made
off with Mr. Schwartz&rsquo;s luggage, even appropriating
a leather dressing-case which was on
the front seat inside, and had fallen on top
of the alarmed occupant. Mr. Schwartz,
when extricated from his dangerous position,
behaved with admirable coolness. He felt in
his pockets, and declared that the rascals who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>had adopted this novel and exceedingly daring
method of highway robbery had only secured
some clothing and other articles which could
be easily replaced. He was naturally somewhat
shaken, however. After liberally compensating
the cab-driver, Mr. Schwartz sought
the escort of two policemen, when he entered
another vehicle to proceed to his house in
Brook-street. During the course of yesterday
the police arrested several negroes, but neither
the cabman nor Mr. Schwartz could identify
any of them, and they were set at liberty.&rsquo; I
think that&rsquo;s rather fine; don&rsquo;t you? Please
don&rsquo;t all speak at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">But they did, and lost their tempers because
nobody could get a hearing; Bob and Prince
John stamped and rattled the chains of their
head-stalls, Dan chased Tibbie up the loft
ladder, and Poll shrieked at Rikki:</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a miserable, cat-whiskered <i>soor-ka
butcha</i>, that&rsquo;s what you are, and I mean it this
time, whatever it is!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">And that is all, I think, for this time.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="ph3">Transcriber&rsquo;s Notes:</p>

<p>Minor changes have been made to regularize hyphenation and correct minor printer errors.</p>

<p>Illustrations have been moved below paragraphs to allow smoother reading in this e-book.</p>

<p>Half page chapter titles before the chapter number have been removed as repetitive.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
